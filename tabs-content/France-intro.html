    <p> Total number of answers: 219 (as of 13/10/2017)
		</p>

		<p> The goal of this survey is to understand the population’s point of view regarding GMOs
      and our “Softer Shock” iGEM project that intends to use GMOs on crops. This study was made
      in the context of Human Practices to annotate the interactive map with relevant data.
		</p>

		<p> 12 out of 23 questions were selected for this survey analysis. Below are shown the results
       related to the public perception of GMOs and our iGEM project. We have benefited from the help
       of other French teams that have shared the survey to their families and friends.
		</p>

		<p> In France, people have a generally negative view of GMOs. Even if 86% of the population
      is aware of what a GMO is, still 61% and 78% think it is not safe for health and for environment.
		</p>

		<p> We also notice 13% are uncertain about what a GMO is. This means that a significant proportion
      of the French population is not sufficiently aware of this subject.

    <h1>French regulation</h1>
    <p>France is one of the most restrictive country regarding the GMO. As a member of the European
    		Union, France is strongly affected by the EU rules, the first one is the directive <b>2001/18/EC</b>, that
    		regulates the release of GMO on the environment and the regulation <b>(EC) No 1829/2003</b>, that
    		defines the modified feed and food that can be placed on the market and can be consumed.<sup>1</sup>
    		Moreover, a national law (<b>Loi 2008-595 du 25 juin 2008</b>) was also voted to provide other restrictions
    		on GMOs. This law also created a high council called the Haut Conseil des Biotechnologies that will
    		discuss the risk of the GMO for the environment and the human health.<sup>2</sup>
    		</p>

    		<p>Also, to prevent the risk of a potential release of GMO in the environment, an international convention has been made that leads to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety on 2000. This protocol can help countries to have a basis regulation and methodology for modified organisms, to harmonize the regulation on biosafety on an international level, and a mechanism for international information exchange on biosafety.<sup>3,4</sup> China ratified the Cartagena protocol on 2005.<sup>5</sup>

              <h2>INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS</h2>

              <p>In France, there are very few industrials projects using GMOs due
                to strict regulation. Most synthetic biology projects use other techniques
                such as mutagenesis (directed or aleatory), or they used purified
                compounds extracted from GMOs.</p>

                <p>Two techniques and label categories were distinguished: GMOs (genetically
                  modified organisms) and GEO (genetically edited organisms). The conclusion
                  was that contemporary French society is more open to the GEO label than the
                  GMO label because of incorrect use of terms by social media which led to the
                  rejection of GMOs. With the positive press surrounding newer techniques such
                  as CRISP-Cas9 and TALEN by PCR mutagenesis (GEO), the general public is more
                  willing to consider genetic engineering of food crops.

                <p>French GEOs research is directed addressing problems such as:

                <p>A major French synthetic biology research center is the Genopole at Evry.
                </p>
                <p>There are numerous French start-up companies that use synthetic biology to
                  address health issues, such as BGene in Grenoble, and PhageX in Paris.

                <p>France also provides financial and material support to entrepreneurs to create their
                  company and work on projects of direct social impact. However, GMO projects are often not
                  positively evaluated due to current national regulations and are projected to have poor
                  economic viability due to negative social and market perception.
