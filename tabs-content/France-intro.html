              <p>In France, there are very few industrials projects using GMOs due
                to strict regulation. Most synthetic biology projects use other techniques
                such as mutagenesis (directed or aleatory), or they used purified
                compounds extracted from GMOs.</p>

                <p>Two techniques and label categories were distinguished: GMOs (genetically
                  modified organisms) and GEO (genetically edited organisms). The conclusion
                  was that contemporary French society is more open to the GEO label than the
                  GMO label because of incorrect use of terms by social media which led to the
                  rejection of GMOs. With the positive press surrounding newer techniques such
                  as CRISP-Cas9 and TALEN by PCR mutagenesis (GEO), the general public is more
                  willing to consider genetic engineering of food crops.

                <p>A major French synthetic biology research center is the Genopole at Evry.
                </p>
                <p>There are numerous French start-up companies that use synthetic biology to
                  address health issues, such as BGene in Grenoble, and PhageX in Paris.
                </p>
                <p>France also provides financial and material support to entrepreneurs to create their
                  company and work on projects of direct social impact. However, GMO projects are often not
                  positively evaluated due to current national regulations and are projected to have poor
                  economic viability due to negative social and market perception.
