		<h1>Survey analysis: Brazil</h1>

		<p><b> Total number of answers: 102 (as of 13/10/2017) </b></p>

		<p> The goal of this survey is to understand the population’s point of view regarding GMOs and our “Softer Shock” iGEM project that intends to use GMOs on crops. This study was made in the context of Human Practices to annotate the interactive map with relevant data.
		</p>

		<p> <span class="orange-text">12 out of 23 questions were selected for this survey analysis</span>. Below are shown the results related to the public perception of GMOs and our iGEM project. We have benefited from the help of other French teams that have shared the survey to their families and friends.
		</p>

		<p>In Brazil people have a <span class="orange-text">global positive view of GMOs</span>. 90% of the population is aware of what a GMO is and <span class="orange-text">51% think it is safe for health and 38% think it is safe for the environment</span>. Therefore, we may well receive positive feedback for our project implementation in Brazil.
		</p>

		<p>We also notice that 32%-33% are uncertain about the safety of GMOs for health and environment. <b>This means that a significant portion of the Brazilian population is not sufficiently informed about these two subjects to make their own opinion</b>.
