		<h1>Survey analysis: Brazil</h1>
  
		<p> Total number of answers: 102 (as of 13/10/2017) </p>

		<p> The goal of this survey is to understand the population’s point of view regarding GMOs and our “Softer Shock” iGEM project that intends to use GMOs on crops. This study was made in the context of Human Practices to annotate the interactive map with relevant data.
		</p>
  
		<p> 12 out of 23 questions were selected for this survey analysis. Below are shown the results related to the public perception of GMOs and our iGEM project. We have benefited from the help of other French teams that have shared the survey to their families and friends.
		</p>
  
		<p>In Brazil people have a global positive view of GMOs. 90% of the population is aware of what a GMO is and 51% think it is safe for health and 38% think it is safe for the environment. Therefore, we may well receive positive feedback for our project implementation in Brazil 
		</p>
  
		<p>We also notice that 32%-33% are uncertain about the safety of GMOs for health and environment. This means that a significant portion of the Brazilian population is not sufficiently informed about these two subjects to make their own opinion. 
		</p>
  
		<h3>Do you know what a GMO is?</h3>
  
		<img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/a/ac/Ionisparis-hp-publicopinion-Br-1.png"/>

		<h3>Do you consider GMOs safe for your health?</h3>

		<img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/8/85/Ionisparis-hp-publicopinion-Br-21.png"/>

		<h3>Do you consider GMO safe for the environment?</h3>
  
		<!--Mettre cette image qui suit à droite de celle du dessus--><img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/a/ac/Ionisparis-hp-publicopinion-Br-22.png"/>
 
		<p> We wanted to know how concerned people were about GMOs in general, and if there were some specific applications that were particularly worrisome. 50% of our respondents felt worried and 10% felt very concerned. This is not exactly in accordance with the previous results but even if people think it is safe to use, there is still a level of concern. 
		</p>
  
		<h3>What is your degree of preoccupation concerning GMOS?</h3>
  
		<img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/2/2f/Ionisparis-hp-publicopinion-Br-3.png"/>
  
		<p> As shown below, the agriculture and environment sector is the main concern of our application domains. We thus know that our product could have difficulty being accepted by the Brazilian population. But since food is not one of the domains people are worried about with GMOs, it has a chance to succeed for the final product, which is wine. 
		</p>
  
		<h3> In which sectors are you preoccupied by the eventual presence of GMOs?</h3>
  
		<img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/thumb/2/28/Ionisparis-hp-publicopinion-Br-4.png/800px-Ionisparis-hp-publicopinion-Br-4.png"/>
  
		<p> Then, we focused on the people’s investment regarding the support and development of GMOs. There is a majority of positive answers (78%) and only 6% negative answers. To investigate the reasons why they were for or against we proposed 2 different answers. For the people involved, we offered them the possibility to select the different domains they were interested in. And for people against, they had to select a reason to their decision.  
		</p>
  
		<h3>Do you support the use or the development of GMOs?</h3>
  
		<img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/8/82/800px-Ionisparis-hp-publicopinion-Br-5.png"/>
  
		<h3>If yes, in which domains? </h3>

		<img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/thumb/6/6b/800px-Ionisparis-hp-publicopinion-Br-6.png/800px-800px-Ionisparis-hp-publicopinion-Br-6.png"/>

		<p>Agriculture and environment is the main domain people are following in terms of GMOs development and use.  
		</p>

		<p>But as seen below, it is also the highest risk underligned by respondents with health risks. Health, here, is not seen as the application domain but more the health risks human can have due to GMOs uses.  
		</p>

		<h3>If not, why? </h3>

		<img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/thumb/1/1d/800px-800px-Ionisparis-hp-publicopinion-Br-7.png/800px-800px-800px-Ionisparis-hp-publicopinion-Br-7.png"/>

		<p> The next part is directly dealing with our project. The aim was to know if people would agree to use our product in their country to fight climate change. Firstly, in asking them about the climatic conditions in their country and if the crops were suffering from global warming. 81% of the persons think Brazil is highly concerned by global warming effects on crops. 
		</p>

		<h3> Do you think agriculture in your country suffers from global warming?</h3>

		<img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/1/1a/800px-800px-800px-Ionisparis-hp-publicopinion-Br-8.png"/>

		<p> Secondly, we introduced our project to know if people would accept the use of a GMO product to protect the crops from bad climatic conditions. For this question, the answers were very divergent with only 6% of negative feedbacks and 75% of positive feedbacks.
		</p>
  
		<h3> Would you be in accordance with the use of GMOs on crops in your country to counter the effect of global warming?</h3>
  
		<img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/2/27/800px-800px-800px-Ionisparis-hp-publicopinion-Br-9.png"/>
  
		<p> This comes with the first conclusion we had before, that our product may well be accepted in Brazil. 
		</p>
  
		<p>For the last part, we wanted to know if our idea of creating an interactive map on a website would be attractive for people to learn more about GMOs in general. We first wanted to know if the population was interested in improving their knowledge about GMOs and the main answer(90%) was yes
		</p>

		<h3> Do you wish to know more about GMOs?</h3>

		<img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/e/e6/800px-800px-800px-Ionisparis-hp-publicopinion-Br-10.png"/>

		<h3> Which support would be the most relevant to know more about GMOs?</h3>
  
		<img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/thumb/7/70/800px-800px-800px-Ionisparis-hp-publicopinion-Br-11.png/800px-800px-800px-800px-Ionisparis-hp-publicopinion-Br-11.png"/>
  
		<p>As shown above, website is the second answer selected as the best support to get more information about GMOs. 
		</p>
  
		<p>In conclusion, our “Softer Shock” product might succeed to find its place in Brazil.  
		</p>
  
		<p>This may be supported by several results: 
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>38% of the population think that GMOs are safe for the environment</li>
			<li> 49 out of 102 (48%) people are supporting the development and use of GMOs in agriculture or environment </li>
		</ul>
  
		<p> And finally, the 75% of persons for the use of GMOs on crops to protect them from harsh temperatures. 
		</p>
  
		<p>Moreover, our interactive map project is in accordance with the population’s requirements. It meets the needs of 90% people that wish to develop their knowledge about GMOs.

		<h1>Regulation Brazil</h1>
  
		<p>Brazil is currently the second producer of GMO behind the United States with an area dedicated to
		GMO crops of 49.1 million of hectares in 2016, and about fifty commercialized GMOs in the country.<sup>1</sup>
		The major regulation about the genetically modified organism, in the country, is the <b>Law 11,105 of
		2005.</b> Following this law, to protect and preserve the environment, a National Biosafety Policy was
		created with National Biosafety Council. Also, a national commission, Comissão Técnica Nacional de
		Biossegurança, is created to regulate the biotechnology sector.<sup>2</sup>
		</p>
  
		<p>Also, to prevent the risk of a potential release of GMO in the environment, an international
		convention has been made that leads to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety on 2000. This protocol
		can help countries to have a basis regulation and methodology for modified organisms, to harmonize
		the regulation on biosafety on an international level, and a mechanism for international information
		exchange on biosafety.<sup>3,4</sup> Brazil ratified the Cartagena protocol on 2003.<sup>5</sup>
		</p>
  
		<h2>Research:</h2>
  
		<p>To practice researches on GMOs, an authorization of the Comissão Técnica Nacional de
		Biossegurança is needed and the laboratories and activities performed must apply under the law
		11,105 and the Normative Resolution No. 2 of 2006.<sup>6</sup>
		</p>
  
		<h2>Cultivation:</h2>
  
		<p>To cultivate GMOs, a company needs to create an Internal Biosafety Council, which must approve the
		release of the crops in the environment. After, a request must be submit to the Comissão Técnica
		Nacional de Biossegurança with:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Information of the GMO crops</li>
			<li>Information of the planned release</li>
			<li>Map of the planned release</li>
			<li>A request for the vegetal material</li>
			<li>A request for the release, and information on the company dated and signed by the legal
			representative of this one</li>
		</ul>
  
		<p>During the cultivation, a minimal distance of 100 meters is needed between GMOs crops and non-
		GMOs. Also, records on security measures, agronomic practices, and data collection on the storage,
		material transfer, and eventual disposal of the GMOs and their by-products must be done.<sup>6,7</sup>
		</p>
  
		<h2>Commercialization:</h2>
  
		<p>Before the commercial release or the import of GMOs product, all the data collected on the product
		must be examined by the Comissão Técnica Nacional de Biossegurança that will judge if the product
		is authorized or not be sell in the country. Once the product is authorized, it needs to be labelled as a
		transgenic product.<sup>8,9</sup>
		</p>
  
		<h2>Consumption:</h2>
  
		<p>GMO food for human consumption is legal in Brazil, if the percentage GMO is superior to 1% in a
		product, this one must include a label to inform the population with the potential effect on the
		human health.<sup>9</sup>
		</p>

		<h1>AGRI-FOOD SECTOR</h1>

		<h2>INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS</h2>
              
		<p>Brazil is the engine of growth in biotech crops worldwide.<sup>1</sup>
		</p>
			  
        <p>Top two after USA of the five countries planting GMs crops, with 49.1 
		million hectares or 27% of the global output. Brazil also had the highest biotech 
		crop growth from 2015 to 2016 with a 4.9% increase.<sup>1</sup>
		</p>
			 
        <p>One of the reasons is that, GMO regulation in Brazil is highly influenced by 
		political and economic interests.
		</p>
			  
        <p>An anecdote from an iGEM 2017 Brazilian USP team member recalls that: 
		“At first GMOs were forbidden to produce in Brazil but some farmers started 
		to use them illegally because they had a better yield and it was less expensive. 
		After few years most of Brazil was using GMOs crop and the government had to allow 
		he country to produce GMOs, in conclusion they banished the law just because 
		they were too many to be controlled and also because of the country economy that 
		was much better using GMOs.”
		</p>
			  
        <p>Since then:
		</p>
			  
        <p>In 2016 alone, Brazil approved a maize cultivar MON89034 (insect resistant) 
		for food, feed and cultivation.<sup>1</sup>
		</p>
			  
        <p>Nowadays, Brazil produces GM soybean, maize and cotton. From 2003 to 2016, 
		Brazil has approved 57 types of GMOs for food, feed processing and cultivation 
		which includes (33 types of maize, 12 types of cotton, 10 types of soybean, one 
		bean type, and one eucalyptus type.<sup>1</sup>
		</p>
			 
        <p>Projects such as the biotech sugarcane and biomass and modified lignin 
		(Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) sugar cane by "editing gene" allowing the degradation 
		and the fermentation of the cellulose, thus the hectare yield in ethanol) are 
		expected to be on the market in Brazil in 2017, according to the Sugarcane 
		Technology Center, CEO, Gustavo Leite are being developed(AFBV “French 
		association of green biotechnologies”).<sup>1</sup>
		</p>
			  
        <p>Today, several companies in Brazil are demonstrating the possibilities 
		that synthetic biology can offer through specific industrial projects:
		</p>
             
		<ul>
			<li><b>FuturaGene Brasil Technology Ltd</b> 
			has developed a fast growing GM eucalyptus with 20 percent higher 
			productivity (between 30 and 40 percent more) for use in non-forestry 
			applications such as bioenergy. This GM eucalyptus was approved for 
			commercial release by CTNBio in April 2015. It represents the beginning 
			of a new era for sustainable forest management, and Brazil is the first 
			country to complete the cycle of development using this technology, which 
			will enhance production using less resources.<sup>1</sup></li>
        </ul>
			  
        <p>The yield increase provided by the GM eucalyptus will provide economic, 
		environmental and social benefits.
		</p>
			  
        <ul>
			<li><b>EMBRAPA and LOTAN Agrosciences</b>, which 
			develop synthetic biology  tools for agricultural purposes.</li>
        </ul>
			  
        <p><b>EMBRAPA</b> is one of the largest public 
		companies active in the research and development of new techniques to improve 
		traditional harvesting and meet Brazilian market demand.<sup>2</sup>
		</p>
			
        <p><b>LOTAN Agrosciences</b> is a start-up created by 
		proper iGEM members from Mexico. They also work in the agricultural sector, using 
		synthetic biology to improve Brazilian crops.
		</p>
            
		<p>New products such as biotech eucalyptus, sugarcane and virus resistant beans 
		are waiting to be commercialized and are expected to impact the Brazilian economy.
		</p>
			  
        <h2>IGEM PROJECTS</h2>
			  
        <h3>iGEM 2015 - Brazil_USP</h3>
			  
        <p>In 2015 the Brazilian iGEM team (USP), developed an innovative and sustainable 
		solution for a significant environmental problem: accumulation of waste tires. 
		Natural rubber degradation may take up to 1000 years.
		</p>
			  
        <p>They created a genetic circuit to express RoxA (rubber oxygenase) and Lcp 
		(latex clearing protein) in E. coli. Both enzymes have been shown to catalyze rubber 
		cleavage to multiple smaller products. Vulcanized rubber will be devulcanized and 
		thereby converted into a suitable growth medium in one bioreactor and then transferred 
		to another bioreactor for degradation using the modified E. coli. This product will then 
		be subjected to further chemical transformations to obtain a final product such as fuel.
		</p>
              
		<p>They did a proof of concept in which they developed some genetic constructs, but some 
		of them have not been completed in time for the iGEM deadline. However, they won a gold medal.
		</p>

		web page</a>.</p>
              
		<h3>iGEM 2013 - Manaus_Amazonas-Brazil</h3>
			  
        <p>This team developed a project that generates electricity through the 
		degradation of fatty acids present in waste frying oil. These oils are present 
		as a pollutant in the environment. Currently, some people use this oil to make 
		soaps, but using fats for energy generation will bring a new option for bioenergy 
		through bioremediation. They used the bacteria Shewanella putrefaciens that is 
		capable of generating electricity through its electron transport systems. This 
		team also won a gold medal.

        <h3>iGEM 2016 - UFAM_UEA-Brazil</h3>
			  
        <p>In 2016, this team developed a mercury resistant bacteria from the Amazon and a 
		bioreactor to treat mercury contaminated water. This project was developed in order 
		to decrease mercury contaminations in the Amazon.They also won a gold medal.

        <h1>HEALTH SECTOR</h1>
				
        <h2>INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS</h2>
				  
        <p>Currently, Brazilian health care research centers only employ traditional 
		molecular techniques (non-GMOs uses).<sup>3</sup>
		</p>
				  
        <p>Synthetic biology is not well developed in the health field. We believe 
		that in few years the health sector will start to use synthetic biology tools 
		as we can see in the article Synthetic Biology: An Emerging Field for Developing 
		Economies.<sup>4</sup> 
		</p>
                  
		<p>In conclusion, to increase biotech projects in Brazil we need involved 
		stakeholders and effective communication with the general public in order to 
		address marketing issues, support scientific research, and encourage industries to 
		invest more in biotechnology solutions.
		</p>

        <h2>IGEM PROJECTS</h2>
			  
        <h3>iGEM 2015 - UFMG_BraziL</h3>
				  
        <p>The UFMG_Brazil team developed in 2015, a new way to deliver drugs and 
		produce them using macrophages and protozoan Leishmania as chassis to carry 
		IFN-beta into macrophages to treat inflammatory joint diseases. They visited 
		several specialists and interviewed some patients in hospitals, as well as a 
		member of a non-governmental organization dedicated to rheumatoid arthritis 
		(RA). The goal was have a better understanding of the medical needs in order 
		to plan a comprehensive and well structured project.
