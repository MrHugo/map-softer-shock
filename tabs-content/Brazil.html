		<h1>BRAZIL</h1>
  
		<p>Brazil is currently the second producer of GMO behind the United States with an area dedicated to
		GMO crops of 49.1 million of hectares in 2016, and about fifty commercialized GMOs in the country.<sup>1</sup>
		The major regulation about the genetically modified organism, in the country, is the <b>Law 11,105 of
		2005.</b> Following this law, to protect and preserve the environment, a National Biosafety Policy was
		created with National Biosafety Council. Also, a national commission, Comissão Técnica Nacional de
		Biossegurança, is created to regulate the biotechnology sector.<sup>2</sup>
		</p>
  
		<p>Also, to prevent the risk of a potential release of GMO in the environment, an international
		convention has been made that leads to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety on 2000. This protocol
		can help countries to have a basis regulation and methodology for modified organisms, to harmonize
		the regulation on biosafety on an international level, and a mechanism for international information
		exchange on biosafety.<sup>3,4</sup> Brazil ratified the Cartagena protocol on 2003.<sup>5</sup>
		</p>
  
		<h2>Research:</h2>
  
		<p>To practice researches on GMOs, an authorization of the Comissão Técnica Nacional de
		Biossegurança is needed and the laboratories and activities performed must apply under the law
		11,105 and the Normative Resolution No. 2 of 2006.<sup>6</sup>
		</p>
  
		<h2>Cultivation:</h2>
  
		<p>To cultivate GMOs, a company needs to create an Internal Biosafety Council, which must approve the
		release of the crops in the environment. After, a request must be submit to the Comissão Técnica
		Nacional de Biossegurança with:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Information of the GMO crops</li>
			<li>Information of the planned release</li>
			<li>Map of the planned release</li>
			<li>A request for the vegetal material</li>
			<li>A request for the release, and information on the company dated and signed by the legal
			representative of this one</li>
		</ul>
  
		<p>During the cultivation, a minimal distance of 100 meters is needed between GMOs crops and non-
		GMOs. Also, records on security measures, agronomic practices, and data collection on the storage,
		material transfer, and eventual disposal of the GMOs and their by-products must be done.<sup>6,7</sup>
		</p>
  
		<h2>Commercialization:</h2>
  
		<p>Before the commercial release or the import of GMOs product, all the data collected on the product
		must be examined by the Comissão Técnica Nacional de Biossegurança that will judge if the product
		is authorized or not be sell in the country. Once the product is authorized, it needs to be labelled as a
		transgenic product.<sup>8,9</sup>
		</p>
  
		<h2>Consumption:</h2>
  
		<p>GMO food for human consumption is legal in Brazil, if the percentage GMO is superior to 1% in a
		product, this one must include a label to inform the population with the potential effect on the
		human health.<sup>9</sup>
		</p>

		<h1>AGRI-FOOD SECTOR</h1>

		<h2>INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS</h2>
              
		<p>Brazil is the engine of growth in biotech crops worldwide.<sup>1</sup>
		</p>
			  
        <p>Top two after USA of the five countries planting GMs crops, with 49.1 
		million hectares or 27% of the global output. Brazil also had the highest biotech 
		crop growth from 2015 to 2016 with a 4.9% increase.<sup>1</sup>
		</p>
			 
        <p>One of the reasons is that, GMO regulation in Brazil is highly influenced by 
		political and economic interests.
		</p>
			  
        <p>An anecdote from an iGEM 2017 Brazilian USP team member recalls that: 
		“At first GMOs were forbidden to produce in Brazil but some farmers started 
		to use them illegally because they had a better yield and it was less expensive. 
		After few years most of Brazil was using GMOs crop and the government had to allow 
		he country to produce GMOs, in conclusion they banished the law just because 
		they were too many to be controlled and also because of the country economy that 
		was much better using GMOs.”
		</p>
			  
        <p>Since then:
		</p>
			  
        <p>In 2016 alone, Brazil approved a maize cultivar MON89034 (insect resistant) 
		for food, feed and cultivation.<sup>1</sup>
		</p>
			  
        <p>Nowadays, Brazil produces GM soybean, maize and cotton. From 2003 to 2016, 
		Brazil has approved 57 types of GMOs for food, feed processing and cultivation 
		which includes (33 types of maize, 12 types of cotton, 10 types of soybean, one 
		bean type, and one eucalyptus type.<sup>1</sup>
		</p>
			 
        <p>Projects such as the biotech sugarcane and biomass and modified lignin 
		(Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) sugar cane by "editing gene" allowing the degradation 
		and the fermentation of the cellulose, thus the hectare yield in ethanol) are 
		expected to be on the market in Brazil in 2017, according to the Sugarcane 
		Technology Center, CEO, Gustavo Leite are being developed(AFBV “French 
		association of green biotechnologies”).<sup>1</sup>
		</p>
			  
        <p>Today, several companies in Brazil are demonstrating the possibilities 
		that synthetic biology can offer through specific industrial projects:
		</p>
             
		<ul>
			<li><b>FuturaGene Brasil Technology Ltd</b> 
			has developed a fast growing GM eucalyptus with 20 percent higher 
			productivity (between 30 and 40 percent more) for use in non-forestry 
			applications such as bioenergy. This GM eucalyptus was approved for 
			commercial release by CTNBio in April 2015. It represents the beginning 
			of a new era for sustainable forest management, and Brazil is the first 
			country to complete the cycle of development using this technology, which 
			will enhance production using less resources.<sup>1</sup></li>
        </ul>
			  
        <p>The yield increase provided by the GM eucalyptus will provide economic, 
		environmental and social benefits.
		</p>
			  
        <ul>
			<li><b>EMBRAPA and LOTAN Agrosciences</b>, which 
			develop synthetic biology  tools for agricultural purposes.</li>
        </ul>
			  
        <p><b>EMBRAPA</b> is one of the largest public 
		companies active in the research and development of new techniques to improve 
		traditional harvesting and meet Brazilian market demand.<sup>2</sup>
		</p>
			
        <p><b>LOTAN Agrosciences</b> is a start-up created by 
		proper iGEM members from Mexico. They also work in the agricultural sector, using 
		synthetic biology to improve Brazilian crops.
		</p>
            
		<p>New products such as biotech eucalyptus, sugarcane and virus resistant beans 
		are waiting to be commercialized and are expected to impact the Brazilian economy.
		</p>
			  
        <h2>IGEM PROJECTS</h2>
			  
        <h3>iGEM 2015 - Brazil_USP</h3>
			  
        <p>In 2015 the Brazilian iGEM team (USP), developed an innovative and sustainable 
		solution for a significant environmental problem: accumulation of waste tires. 
		Natural rubber degradation may take up to 1000 years.
		</p>
			  
        <p>They created a genetic circuit to express RoxA (rubber oxygenase) and Lcp 
		(latex clearing protein) in E. coli. Both enzymes have been shown to catalyze rubber 
		cleavage to multiple smaller products. Vulcanized rubber will be devulcanized and 
		thereby converted into a suitable growth medium in one bioreactor and then transferred 
		to another bioreactor for degradation using the modified E. coli. This product will then 
		be subjected to further chemical transformations to obtain a final product such as fuel.
		</p>
              
		<p>They did a proof of concept in which they developed some genetic constructs, but some 
		of them have not been completed in time for the iGEM deadline. However, they won a gold medal.

		<h3>iGEM 2013 - Manaus_Amazonas-Brazil</h3>
			  
        <p>This team developed a project that generates electricity through the 
		degradation of fatty acids present in waste frying oil. These oils are present 
		as a pollutant in the environment. Currently, some people use this oil to make 
		soaps, but using fats for energy generation will bring a new option for bioenergy 
		through bioremediation. They used the bacteria Shewanella putrefaciens that is 
		capable of generating electricity through its electron transport systems. This 
		team also won a gold medal.

        <h3>iGEM 2016 - UFAM_UEA-Brazil</h3>
			  
        <p>In 2016, this team developed a mercury resistant bacteria from the Amazon and a 
		bioreactor to treat mercury contaminated water. This project was developed in order 
		to decrease mercury contaminations in the Amazon.They also won a gold medal.

        <h1>HEALTH SECTOR</h1>
				
        <h2>INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS</h2>
				  
        <p>Currently, Brazilian health care research centers only employ traditional 
		molecular techniques (non-GMOs uses).<sup>3</sup>
		</p>
				  
        <p>Synthetic biology is not well developed in the health field. We believe 
		that in few years the health sector will start to use synthetic biology tools 
		as we can see in the article Synthetic Biology: An Emerging Field for Developing 
		Economies.<sup>4</sup> 
		</p>
                  
		<p>In conclusion, to increase biotech projects in Brazil we need involved 
		stakeholders and effective communication with the general public in order to 
		address marketing issues, support scientific research, and encourage industries to 
		invest more in biotechnology solutions.
		</p>

        <h2>IGEM PROJECTS</h2>
			  
        <h3>iGEM 2015 - UFMG_BraziL</h3>
				  
        <p>The UFMG_Brazil team developed in 2015, a new way to deliver drugs and 
		produce them using macrophages and protozoan Leishmania as chassis to carry 
		IFN-beta into macrophages to treat inflammatory joint diseases. They visited 
		several specialists and interviewed some patients in hospitals, as well as a 
		member of a non-governmental organization dedicated to rheumatoid arthritis 
		(RA). The goal was have a better understanding of the medical needs in order 
		to plan a comprehensive and well structured project.

        <p>The UNICAMP-EMSE Brazil team developed in 2011, a system that uses the 
		ability of some microorganisms to sense changes in the host’s body homeostasis 
		and trigger the expression of virulence factors to balance the pathological 
		imbalance.
