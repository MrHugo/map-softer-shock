    <p>Since 1996, genetically modified seeds have been available in the United States. Currently, genetically modified maize, soybean and cotton crops are the overwhelming majority of crops.<sup>1</sup>
</p>
<p> Nowadays, many companies in USA are working on synthetic biology to performing the nutritional value of crops. Recently, Rutgers scientist discovered a way to reduce animal feed and food production costs by increasing a key nutrient in corn. They found an efficient way to enhance the nutritional value of corn by inserting a bacterial gene that causes it to produce a key nutrient called methionine. This new discovery could benefit millions of people in developing countries but also for the reducing worldwide animal feed costs.<sup>2</sup>

    <p>The United States is in the lead position in SB research: they host most of the research entities (institutes or universities), and conduct most of the R&D activities.
</p>

<p>They have a web page called “synthetic biology projects” in which you can map the emerging synthetic Biology landscape in US. The <a target = "_blank" href="http://www.synbioproject.org/news/" > web page</a>
