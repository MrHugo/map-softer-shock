        <h1>AGRI-FOOD SECTOR</h1>

        <h2>INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS</h2>

        <p>Mexico has been planting biotech crops since 1996, and is one of the six
        pioneer with USA, Brazil, Canada, India and Argentina and biotech planting
        countries.<sup>1</sup>
        </p>

        <p>Since 1996, Mexico had 158 approvals for GMOs food cultivars and feed use.
        </p>

        <p>In 2016 Mexico planted 101,000 hectares of biotech crops, down from 141,000
        hectares in 2015. The 101,000 hectares are cotton and soybean, cotton being one
        of the most important GMO crop grown in Mexico.<sup>1</sup>
        </p>

        <p>However, there are still negative propaganda and cultural prejudices that opponents
        use to confuse the public about the technology, it happens the same in other countries
        such as France.
        </p>

        <p>In conclusion, to increase biotech projects in Mexico we need involved stakeholders
        and effective communication with the general public in order to address marketing issues
        and support scientific research and industrial investment in applications of biotechnology.
        </p>

        <p>Currently, a few companies in Mexico are demonstrating some of the practical possibilities
        that synthetic biology can offers:<sup>1</sup>
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>The National Institute of Forestry, Agriculture and
          Livestock Research (INIFAP)</b> has developed GMO beans (Phaseolus vulgaris)
          with resistance to fungi Colletorichum lindemuthianum, Fusarium lateritium and
          Rhizoctonia solani. The beans were tested in Celaya, Guanajuato after a permit
          for experimental release was granted in 2014.</li>
          <li><b>The International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center
          (CIMMYT)</b> have tested experimental releases of GM wheat over the last seven
          years with various traits including drought tolerance.</li>
          <li><b>The National Laboratory of Genomics for Biodiversity
          (LANGEBIO), Advanced Studies (CINVESTAV) and a private company</b> are
          developing biotech crops that will absorb and optimize the use of phosphorus.</li>
          <li><b>CINVESTAV</b> is also developing a GMO lemon tree
          (Citrus aurantifolia) resistant to the disease known as Huanglongbing (HLB) which
          causes losses of lemon crops each year.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Biotechnology in the environmental sector is very beneficial for Mexico;
        </p>

        <p>Since 1996, biotech cotton farmers from Chihuahua have saved 30 percent on
        their production costs due to reduced pesticide use, going from 18 applications
        per growing season to just one.<sup>2</sup>
        </p>

        <p>Biotech improvements to soybean and cotton are estimated to have increased
        Mexican revenues by US$489 million from 1996 to 2015. The profits alone for 2015
        are estimated at US$77 million (Brookes and Barfoot).
        </p>

            <h2>IGEM PROJECTS</h2>

            <h3>iGEM 2010 - Tec-Monterrey</h3>

            <p>The iGEM 2010 Tec-Monterrey team from Mexico developed a new concentrated
        bacterial sensor using genetically modified microorganisms. Using genetic
        engineering has resulted in more sophisticated bacterial reporters that
        will be capable of detecting more easily the presence of contaminants, sugars
        and amino acids in different media such as soil and water.

            <h3>iGEM 2012 - UANL_Mty</h3>

            <p>The 2012 iGEM UANL_Mty team from Mexico, created a system using
        an arsenic biosensor and a chelator made by preior iGEM teams for
        bio-remediation of heavy metal and metalloid contamination. They did
        several lectures and activities with school students to share knowledge
        and teach them synthetic biology. They performed several DNA extractions
        among other introductory experiments.

            <h1>HEALTH SECTOR</h1>

            <h2>INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS</h2>

            <p>In October 2009, Mexican researchers and companies directors discussed
        about the future development of applied synthetic biology, reaching two
        main conclusions. First, Mexico is is relatively late in examining these
        issues. Secondly, the research directions that would allow Mexico to be
        competitive were not clearly defined.
        <a target= "_blank" href="http://www.biosintetica.mx">http://www.biosintetica.mx</a>
        </p>

        <p>Since then Mexico has seen the formation of associations such as
        <a target= "_blank" href="http://www.biosintetica.mx">Biosintetica</a>
        to promote synthetic biology research and technological
        development in the Mexican academic and industrial sectors.
        </p>

        <p>Despite this, Mexico has made important contributions to synthetic biology.
        </p>

        <p>In 1980, the Mexican scientist Francisco Bolivar Zapata was able to access
        the DNA of a pancreatic cell and from there obtained the gene that encodes insulin.
        </p>

        <p>Thanks to the isolation of this gene, it could be inserted into a vector
        called pBR 322. The vector and the insert were incorporated into a recombinant
        bacterium. Subsequently they were put into a fermentation tank and with this
        it was possible the unlimited reproduction of the high purity insulin.
        </p>

        <p>Current Mexican synthetic biology projects:
        </p>

        <p>In general, no established companies use genetic engineering in the
        health sector.<sup>3</sup>
        </p>

        <p>However, several Mexican universities have departments that work with
        synthetic biology such as:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>The center of research CINVESTAV</b>
          in Irapuato has a department of genetic engineering  active in several
          health sector applications of synthetic biology.<sup>4</sup></li>
          <li><b>“Red synbioMX”</b> is The National
          Synthetic Biology Network of Mexico. It is presented as a web page made
          from a collective effort of researchers and students working in synthetic
          biology in Mexico and abroad. It is an non-profit interface with the goal
          of keeping the Mexican society informed about synthetic biology news.<sup>5</sup></li>
            </ul>

            <p>For example, a group of graduate students from the National Polytechnic Institute
        in Guanajuato created GATCorp which is the first start-up of synthetic biology in Mexico.
        The purpose of GATCorp is to incorporate biotechnological processes in the natural and
        chemical products’ industry in Mexico.<sup>6</sup>
        </p>

        <p>Red synbioMX has the goal of popularizing synthetic biology through activities,
        lectures and conferences to unite all sectors that work on synthetic biology. For
        more information and the latest news about synthetic biology projects in Mexico,
        visit their <a target= "_blank" href="https://synbiomx.org/">web page</a>.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>“Bread for all”</b>developed in Spain and
          Mexico,is a project in the health sector that is being developed to find
          wheat varieties for people allergic to gluten.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Celiac disease, or "gluten intolerance", affects 1% of consumers. The
        recent CRISPR / Cas9 technique offers the hope of being able to modify the
        epitopes involved in celiac disease and to lead to acceptable varieties,
        that is to say to low levels of gliadins guilty of allergies, and thus to be
        consumed by the sick. Trials are under way for 10 and 20 people with celiac
        disease respectively.<sup>7</sup>
        </p>

        <p>They have a SynthechBio Network made by reserachers that supports biohacking
        and do it yourself-biology initiatives (DIY-Bio). SynthechBio has been
        communicating and organizing activities in several South American countries
        such as Peru, Argentina and Brazil to promote synthetic biology.<sup>8</sup>

        <h2>IGEM PROJECTS</h2>

        <h3>iGEM 2014 - ITESM-CEM Mexico</h3>

        <p>The iGEM 2014 ITESM-CEM team from Mexico worked on a preventive gene therapy
        for atherosclerosis using microbial enzymes. This project was motivated by the
        fact that the human body is unable to degrade many substances that affect our
        health and so these substances start to accumulate slowly and finally reduce our
        lifespan. They try to build a system using synthetic biology to degrade oxidized
        cholesterol. They also did several talks and courses about their project, about
        molecular and synthetic biology, and the positive impacts they could have on society.

            <h3>iGEM 2013 - BIOSINT_MEXICO</h3>

            <p>The iGEM 2013 BIOSINT team from Mexico developed a smart probiotic that
        included a sensor for xenobiotic substances that will detect and degrade
        pesticides in the body. This project has the goal to provide possible solutions
        for health issues in Mexico.
