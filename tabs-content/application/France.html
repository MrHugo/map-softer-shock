        <h1>AGRI-FOOD SECTOR</h1>

        <h2>INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS</h2>

        <p>In France, there are very few industrials projects using GMOs due
        to strict regulation. Most synthetic biology projects use other techniques
        such as mutagenesis (directed or aleatory), or they used purified
        compounds extracted from GMOs.
        </p>

        <p>On the October 17 2017 the 7th Symposium on Plant Biotechnology, organized
        by the Scientific Council of the French Association of Plant Biotechnology (AFBV)
        was held in Paris.
        </p>

        <p>Two techniques and label categories were distinguished: GMOs (genetically
        modified organisms) and GEO (genetically edited organisms). The conclusion
        was that contemporary French society is more open to the GEO label than the
        GMO label because of incorrect use of terms by social media which led to the
        rejection of GMOs. With the positive press surrounding newer techniques such
        as CRISP-Cas9 and TALEN by PCR mutagenesis (GEO), the general public is more
        willing to consider genetic engineering of food crops.
        </p>

        <p>French research is directed at addressing problems such as:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Cultivars with high productivity yet requiring fewer inputs</b></li>
          <li><b>Disease resistance</b></li>
          <li><b>Cultivars with specific nutritional value added</b></li>
            </ul>

            <p>To solve these problems researchers are working on several methods using
        molecular markers, genomic selection, and gene editing.
        </p>

        <p>However, these objectives require investment over time and a stable and clear
        a regulatory framework for market approval at national, regional (European Union)
        , and global levels.
        </p>

        <p>France has several companies that work in the synthetic biology field such as
        Deinove, Le Genopole, Syngenta, Total,  l’INRA, Bayer, and Limagrain to name a few.
        </p>

        <p>They are also many controversies about mutagenesis because many people think they
        are the “hidden iGEM”. Indeed, mutagenesis is different from an organism genetically
        engineer because with mutagenesis we generate mutations on purpose in a variety of crop
        in order to develop a specific mutation against a virus, bacteria, bug etc and to “copy”
        the function of a created part to do a genetically engineered organism.
        </p>

            <p>French regulation follows European Union regulations on GMOs.<sup>1</sup> See the
        regulation part. France decided to not produce GMOs. Negative media coverage and cultural
        prejudice against GMOs have made it very difficult to market the products of synthetic
        biology research.
        </p>

            <p>France’s GMO regulation is directed by the European Commission, which means that
        all European countries follow the same regulation about GMO regulation, but each county
        is free to choose if they want to produce GMOs in their country. France voted to forbid
        GMO production in 2015.
        </p>

        <p>The European Academy of Science has stated that “There is compelling evidence that GM
        crops can contribute to sustainable development goals with benefits to farmers, consumers,
        the environment and the economy”.<sup>2</sup>We have some perspectives from European
        countries which allow GMO production:
        </p>

        <p>Farmers make important choices every season regarding the various tools they have to
        produce the best crops. In countries where farmers have the choice, biotech seeds are among
        those tools. GM crops allow farmers to grow more without using additional land. In addition,
        crop biotechnology has contributed to significantly reducing the release of greenhouse gas
        emissions from agricultural practices.
        </p>

        <p>In 2014, this was equivalent to removing 22.4 billion kg of carbon dioxide from the
        atmosphere, or equal to removing 10 million cars from the road for one year.<sup>3</sup>
        </p>

        <p>GMO can support food security, economic development, and the environment by improving
        resistance to pests, weeds, diseases, and developing drought or flood tolerant crops.
        </p>

        <p>The European Academy of Science, the World Health Organization, the European Commission
        and the European Food Safety Authority agreed GM crops are at least as safe as conventional
        crops improved through selective breeding. In 2000 and 2010, the European Commission released
        two reports that cover 25 years of research, which concluded that GMOs are just as safe as
        conventional plants.<sup>4</sup>
        </p>

        <p>It is for this reason that France needs active stakeholders and effective communication with
        the general public in order to address marketing issues and support scientific research and
        industries to invest more in biotechnologies applications.
        </p>

        <p>This is broader context and goal of the Human Practices part of our iGEM project.</p>

            <h2>IGEM PROJECTS</h2>

            <h3>iGEM 2015 - Bordeaux</h3>

            <p>The iGEM 2015 Bordeaux team worked on a project related to vineyard protection
        against downy mildew. They used Escherichia coli and saw that this microorganism
        already produces curdlan (polymer of glucose) biosynthesis but they miss one enzyme.
        </p>

        <p> After production and purification they sulphated the curdlan and sprayed it on
        grapevines to protect them against mildew infections. They also won the gold medal.
        </p>

        <a target= "_blank" href="http://2015.igem.org/Team:Bordeaux/Description">
        web page</a>.</p>

            <h3>iGEM 2013 - Paris-Saclay</h3>

        <p>The team Paris-Saclay in 2013, worked on a project to degrade PCBs (Polychlorinated
        Biphenyls), ban in France since 1987. This compound is found in electrical equipment
        is toxic to the environment and humans. Currently, we still find PCBs in the water
        of la Seine, a major river of commercial importance in France which transits Paris.
        The team generated a synthetic bacterium that will efficiently biodegrade PCBs.
        They developed several BioBricks to detect PCB and degrade it.
        </p>

        <p>They won the Gold medal.</p>

            <h1>HEALTH SECTOR</h1>

            <h2>INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS</h2>

            <p>A major French synthetic biology research center is the Genopole at Evry.
        </p>

        <p>It is one of the first bioclusters (research center) in France. It is
        composed of 82 biotechnology companies, 25 shared technology platforms, and
        19 academic research laboratories, foremost of which is the Institute of Systems
        & Synthetic Biology. iSSB works on several subjects, one of which is the
        engineering of cellular components to develop safe GMOs whose in vivo generation
        and functionality can be strictly controlled and allow new advancements in the
        biotechnology field.
        </p>

        <p>There are numerous French start-up companies that use synthetic biology to
        address health issues, such as BGene in Grenoble, and PhageX in Paris.
        </p>

        <p>“Synthetic biology has been identified as a national research priority
        and innovation strategy due to its strong economic potential in broad application
        domains (health, environment, energy and materials)”.- Recherche.gouv.fr
        </p>

        <p>France also hosts open access “bio-hacking” labs, such as La Paillasse in Paris,
        where smaller researcher teams can do DIY (do it yourself) projects. This fosters
        the development of synthetic biology projects in these sectors and facilitates their
        transition to the start-up phase without requiring large financial investments.<sup>1</sup>
         </p>

        <p>France also provides financial and material support to entrepreneurs to create their
        company and work on projects of direct social impact. However, GMO projects are often not
        positively evaluated due to current national regulations and are projected to have poor
        economic viability due to negative social and market perception.
        </p>

            <h2>IGEM PROJECTS</h2>

            <h3>iGEM 2016 - Bordeaux</h3>

            <p>The iGEM 2016 Bordeaux team’s project aimed to innovate sleeping pills with
        a new molecule called DSIP, a sleep-inducing peptide. They employed techniques such
        as EpiCRISPR and a photo-inducible system to create a new tool to modify the sleep
        genes and compare which one is more effective at inducing sleep in Caenorhabditis elegans.

            <h3>iGEM 2013 - Evry</h3>

            <p>The 2013 iGEM Evry team worked on a project called “Iron Coli”, in which
        they created a treatment for hemochromatosis and thalassemia. They used synthetic
        biology to prevent the intestinal absorption of iron. The used E.coli and
        engineered the Ferric Uptake Regulation (FUR) pathway so that they can produce
        iron chelators in response to high concentrations of iron. These engineered bacteria
        are delivered to the intestine in a polymer capsule. This system is very interesting
        because it will be less expensive than the existing treatments.
        </p>
