        <h1>AGRI-FOOD SECTOR</h1>


            <h2>INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS</h2>

            <p>1998: Spain started using GM maize.
        </p>

        <p>Since then, Spain has qualified as one of the 18 biotech “mega-countries”
        growing more than 50,000 hectares.<sup>1</sup>
        </p>

        <p>Spain remains one of the few EU countries that allows the use of GM crops
        and has become the highest yielding producer in EU.
        </p>

        <p>The autonomous regions of Aragon and Catalonia had the largest share of
        biotech maize (70%) of Spain’s total biotech maize plantings, as the corn borer
        insect is endemic in these areas.
        </p>

        <p>Today, some companies in Spain are demonstrating the possibilities that synthetic
        biology can offer through fundamental and applied research projects:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>In Madrid,<b>the CSIC (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones
          Científicas)</b> built a research center called “CNB” (Centro Nacional de
          Biotechnologia) in 1992. Many prestigious Spanish researcher work in this center
          on several projects in synthetic biology such as Victor de Lorenzo who is one of
          the main drivers of synthetic biology in Spain.<sup>2</sup></li>
            </ul>

            <p>They are developing multiple biological agents for biosensing, remediation, and
        transformation of urban and industrial chemical waste that is dumped into the environment.
        </p>

        <p>One of the tools they use is the bacterium Pseudomonas putida, easy to work with
        and a reliable chassis for implantation of genetic and metabolic circuits.
        </p>

        <p>Perspectives for the future <sup>3</sup>:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>BioCassava Plus Project:</b>
          Improve the nutritional qualities of cassava.</li>
          <li><b>Africa Biofortified Sorghum Project:</b>
          Develop a more nutritious and easily digestible sorghum that contains
          increased levels of amino acids, vitamins, iron and zinc. Sorghum is
          the fifth most important cereal crop and the main dietary staple for more
          than 500 million people.</li>
          <li><b>Water Efficient Maize for Africa (WEMA)
          Project:</b> Developing drought-tolerant maize, a staple that more
          that more 300 million Africans depend on as their main food source.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>How does synthetic biology impact Spain?<sup>4</sup>
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Economic benefits or farmers due to higher yields and a lower cost of inputs.</li>
                <li>Water savings equivalent to the use of almost 750.000 citizens.</li>
                <li>Farmers margins improved by up to 147 € per hectare.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>IGEM PROJECTS</h2>

            <h3>iGEM 2013 - Valencia-CIPF</h3>

            <p>In 2013, the iGEM team Valencia-CIPF worked on developing a device to create an
        organism capable of repelling insects.
        </p>

        <p>This device will be used in areas of Africa, Asia, and the Americas that suffer
        from diseases like malaria, sleeping sickness or cholera.
        </p>

        <p>They used the properties of monoterpenes from <i>Arabodpsis thaliana</i>
        (able to repel some insects) and the S-linalool synthase gene from <i>Clarkia
        breweri</i>, responsible for the aroma. They introduce the gene responsible
        inside a yeast so that the repellent would always be expressed.
        </p>

            <h3>iGEM 2016 - UPO_SEVILLLA</h3>

            <p>The iGEM 2016 team UPO SEVILLA, worked on a project to eliminate
        glycerol from the environment by using it as a carbon source for bacteria.
        The microorganism they used was <i>Pseudomonas putida</i>, capable of adhering
        to a substrate and aggregating to form communities or biofilms. Their goal
        was to produce compounds that are beneficial for human beings. They
        genetically manipulate <i>P. putida</i> to increase glycerol assimilation and
        to control formation and dispersal of biofilms.

            <h1>HEALTH SECTOR</h1>

            <h2>INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS</h2>

            <p>Nowadays, some companies in Spain are doing projects to show
        the possibilities that synthetic biology can offer in the health
        sector through projects:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><u>Victor Lorenzo</u> is working in the development of an
          artificial immune system using synthetic biology at the CNB.<sup>1</sup></br>
          Scientists say that artificial bacteria will be able to reprogram
          stem cells and regenerate all types of tissues or damaged organs,
          so they can instantly detect and treat tumour cells.<sup>2</sup></li>
          <li><u>Francis Mojica</u> researcher at the University of Alicante,
            who discovered that bacteria use a method to develop immunity that
            opened the door to revolution in genetic manipulation. He discovered
            the CRISPR-Cas9 system.
            The technique, today worth billions of dollars, came from the
            study of microbes in Santa Pola.</li>
        </ul>

            <p>This year, genetic testing will be tested against diseases such as
        cancer or HIV in Spain.
         </p>

        <ul>
          <li>The Research Group on Synthesis of active principles and chemistry
          of steroids at the University of Valladolid (UVa), led by <u>Professor
          Alfonso Pérez Encabo</u> works on developing new products and new
          synthetic routes using steroids for the the pharmaceutical industry.<sup>3</sup></li>
          <li><u>Ricard Solé</u> principal investigator of the University Pompeu
          Fabra (UPF), proposes the use of synthetic biology to counteract the
          anthropogenic effects on our planet through the design of bacteria that
          degrade plastic polymers. <sup>4</sup></li>
          <li>Wheat varieties for people allergic to gluten "Bread for all" is an
          other project developed in Spain and Mexico.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Celiac disease, or "gluten intolerance", affects 1% of consumers. The
        recent CRISPR / Cas9 technique offers the hope of being able to modify the
        epitopes involved in celiac disease and to lead to acceptable varieties, that
        is to say to low levels of gliadins guilty of allergies, and thus to be consumed
        by the sick. Trials are under way for 10 and 20 people with celiac disease
        respectively.<sup>5</sup>
        </p>

        <p>They have two main approaches to designing microorganisms:<sup>6</sup>
        </p>

        <ol>
                <li> Modification of existing organisms and the creation of
          a dependence between them necessary to survive (obligate mutualism).
          This strategy could make it possible to avoid the transition to a desert
          state in arid ecosystems (40% of the planet's ecosystems).</li>
                <li> Design of organisms capable of surviving in a specific substrate,
          such as industrial waste. Proper design would allow these organisms to
          be viable only in these artificial media.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>The same group is working on biological computers, groups of genetically
        modified cells that act in part following conventional binary logic but with
        a design that moves away from both electronics and biological designs. This
        could permit applications related to "intelligent" biosensors or the creation
        of diagnostic kits, for example.
        </p>

            <h2>IGEM PROJECTS</h2>

            <h3>iGEM 2016 - UPF-CRG Barcelona</h3>

            <p>The team UPF-CRG from Barcelona, performed in 2016 a project in developing
        a probiotic that could reduce the amount of polyamines that our body absorb.
        These polyamines in high concentrations are responsible of in a long term increase
        the probabilities of developing cancer, they are found in processed meats among other dishes.
        </p>

        <p>Their probiotic will consist of a mix of different modified bacteria that
        will simply process the excess part of polyamines from the digestion and eliminate
        them using a set of natural enzymes also found in our bodies. The probiotic will be
        consumed as an oral pill. They had also planned to develop a cancer risk detector
        by engineering a bacterial cell. In that case they will use the acetylated version
        of polyamines that have been targeted in previous studies to have a high success
        in both sensibility and specificity of cancer risk detection.
        </p>

            <h3>iGEM 2011 - UPO_SEVILLA</h3>

            <p>The team UPO from Sevilla, developed in 2011, molecular systems
        that reproduce an electronic flip-flop (a device that switches between
        two different states (0 to 1) allowing the construction of living memory
        devices closer to the robustness of informatics. The idea came from prior
        iGEM teams, so they took their system and improved it by constructing
        different regulation levels in a different model organisms such as bacteria
        or yeast. They won a prize for the Best Human Practice project in Europe
        in which they created a Spanish web page to communicate about synthetic
        biology in Spain.
