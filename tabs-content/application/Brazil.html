        <h1>AGRI-FOOD SECTOR</h1>

        <h2>INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS</h2>

        <p>Brazil is the engine of growth in biotech crops worldwide.<sup>1</sup>
        </p>

            <p>Top two after USA of the five countries planting GMs crops, with 49.1
        million hectares or 27% of the global output. Brazil also had the highest biotech
        crop growth from 2015 to 2016 with a 4.9% increase.<sup>1</sup>
        </p>

            <p>One of the reasons is that, GMO regulation in Brazil is highly influenced by
        political and economic interests.
        </p>

            <p>An anecdote from an iGEM 2017 Brazilian USP team member recalls that:
        “At first GMOs were forbidden to produce in Brazil but some farmers started
        to use them illegally because they had a better yield and it was less expensive.
        After few years most of Brazil was using GMOs crop and the government had to allow
        he country to produce GMOs, in conclusion they banished the law just because
        they were too many to be controlled and also because of the country economy that
        was much better using GMOs.”
        </p>

            <p>Since then:
        </p>

            <p>In 2016 alone, Brazil approved a maize cultivar MON89034 (insect resistant)
        for food, feed and cultivation.<sup>1</sup>
        </p>

            <p>Nowadays, Brazil produces GM soybean, maize and cotton. From 2003 to 2016,
        Brazil has approved 57 types of GMOs for food, feed processing and cultivation
        which includes (33 types of maize, 12 types of cotton, 10 types of soybean, one
        bean type, and one eucalyptus type.<sup>1</sup>
        </p>

            <p>Projects such as the biotech sugarcane and biomass and modified lignin
        (Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) sugar cane by "editing gene" allowing the degradation
        and the fermentation of the cellulose, thus the hectare yield in ethanol) are
        expected to be on the market in Brazil in 2017, according to the Sugarcane
        Technology Center, CEO, Gustavo Leite are being developed(AFBV “French
        association of green biotechnologies”).<sup>1</sup>
        </p>

            <p>Today, several companies in Brazil are demonstrating the possibilities
        that synthetic biology can offer through specific industrial projects:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>FuturaGene Brasil Technology Ltd</b>
          has developed a fast growing GM eucalyptus with 20 percent higher
          productivity (between 30 and 40 percent more) for use in non-forestry
          applications such as bioenergy. This GM eucalyptus was approved for
          commercial release by CTNBio in April 2015. It represents the beginning
          of a new era for sustainable forest management, and Brazil is the first
          country to complete the cycle of development using this technology, which
          will enhance production using less resources.<sup>1</sup></li>
            </ul>

            <p>The yield increase provided by the GM eucalyptus will provide economic,
        environmental and social benefits.
        </p>

            <ul>
          <li><b>EMBRAPA and LOTAN Agrosciences</b>, which
          develop synthetic biology  tools for agricultural purposes.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>EMBRAPA</b> is one of the largest public
        companies active in the research and development of new techniques to improve
        traditional harvesting and meet Brazilian market demand.<sup>2</sup>
        </p>

            <p><b>LOTAN Agrosciences</b> is a start-up created by
        proper iGEM members from Mexico. They also work in the agricultural sector, using
        synthetic biology to improve Brazilian crops.
        </p>

        <p>New products such as biotech eucalyptus, sugarcane and virus resistant beans
        are waiting to be commercialized and are expected to impact the Brazilian economy.
        </p>

            <h2>IGEM PROJECTS</h2>

            <h3>iGEM 2015 - Brazil_USP</h3>

            <p>In 2015 the Brazilian iGEM team (USP), developed an innovative and sustainable
        solution for a significant environmental problem: accumulation of waste tires.
        Natural rubber degradation may take up to 1000 years.
        </p>

            <p>They created a genetic circuit to express RoxA (rubber oxygenase) and Lcp
        (latex clearing protein) in E. coli. Both enzymes have been shown to catalyze rubber
        cleavage to multiple smaller products. Vulcanized rubber will be devulcanized and
        thereby converted into a suitable growth medium in one bioreactor and then transferred
        to another bioreactor for degradation using the modified E. coli. This product will then
        be subjected to further chemical transformations to obtain a final product such as fuel.
        </p>

        <p>They did a proof of concept in which they developed some genetic constructs, but some
        of them have not been completed in time for the iGEM deadline. However, they won a gold medal.
        </p>

        <h3>iGEM 2013 - Manaus_Amazonas-Brazil</h3>

            <p>This team developed a project that generates electricity through the
        degradation of fatty acids present in waste frying oil. These oils are present
        as a pollutant in the environment. Currently, some people use this oil to make
        soaps, but using fats for energy generation will bring a new option for bioenergy
        through bioremediation. They used the bacteria Shewanella putrefaciens that is
        capable of generating electricity through its electron transport systems. This
        team also won a gold medal.

            <h3>iGEM 2016 - UFAM_UEA-Brazil</h3>

            <p>In 2016, this team developed a mercury resistant bacteria from the Amazon and a
        bioreactor to treat mercury contaminated water. This project was developed in order
        to decrease mercury contaminations in the Amazon.They also won a gold medal.

            <h1>HEALTH SECTOR</h1>

            <h2>INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS</h2>

            <p>Currently, Brazilian health care research centers only employ traditional
        molecular techniques (non-GMOs uses).<sup>3</sup>
        </p>

            <p>Synthetic biology is not well developed in the health field. We believe
        that in few years the health sector will start to use synthetic biology tools
        as we can see in the article Synthetic Biology: An Emerging Field for Developing
        Economies.<sup>4</sup>
        </p>

        <p>In conclusion, to increase biotech projects in Brazil we need involved
        stakeholders and effective communication with the general public in order to
        address marketing issues, support scientific research, and encourage industries to
        invest more in biotechnology solutions.
        </p>

            <h2>IGEM PROJECTS</h2>

            <h3>iGEM 2015 - UFMG_BraziL</h3>

            <p>The UFMG_Brazil team developed in 2015, a new way to deliver drugs and
        produce them using macrophages and protozoan Leishmania as chassis to carry
        IFN-beta into macrophages to treat inflammatory joint diseases. They visited
        several specialists and interviewed some patients in hospitals, as well as a
        member of a non-governmental organization dedicated to rheumatoid arthritis
        (RA). The goal was have a better understanding of the medical needs in order
        to plan a comprehensive and well structured project.

            <h3>iGEM 2011 - UNICAMP-EMSE Brazil</h3>

            <p>The UNICAMP-EMSE Brazil team developed in 2011, a system that uses the
        ability of some microorganisms to sense changes in the host’s body homeostasis
        and trigger the expression of virulence factors to balance the pathological
        imbalance.
