		<h1>France</h1>
  
		<p>France is one of the most restrictive country regarding the GMO. As a member of the European
		Union, France is strongly affected by the EU rules, the first one is the directive <b>2001/18/EC</b>, that
		regulates the release of GMO on the environment and the regulation <b>(EC) No 1829/2003</b>, that
		defines the modified feed and food that can be placed on the market and can be consumed.<sup>1</sup>
		Moreover, a national law (<b>Loi 2008-595 du 25 juin 2008</b>) was also voted to provide other restrictions
		on GMOs. This law also created a high council called the Haut Conseil des Biotechnologies that will
		discuss the risk of the GMO for the environment and the human health.<sup>2</sup>
		</p>
  
		<p>Also, to prevent the risk of a potential release of GMO in the environment, an international convention has been made that leads to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety on 2000. This protocol can help countries to have a basis regulation and methodology for modified organisms, to harmonize the regulation on biosafety on an international level, and a mechanism for international information exchange on biosafety.<sup>3,4</sup> China ratified the Cartagena protocol on 2005.<sup>5</sup>
		</p>
  
		<h2>Research:</h2>
  
		<p>If the GMO is considered as safe for the environment or the public health, a declaration to the
		government must be done before the beginning of the test. At the contrary, if the organism may be a
		potential risk, an authorization of the research ministry is needed with the opinion of the Haut
		Conseil des Biotechnologies.<sup>6</sup>
		</p>
  
		<h2>Cultivation:</h2>
  
		<p>To cultivate GMOs, an authorization of the environment ministry is required with an evaluation of
		the Haut Conseil des Biotechnologies to determine if the organism can present risk for the human
		health or for the environment. Also the public needs to be informed about the future cultivation
		through a website and the local authorities of the area must have advanced notice.
		</p>
  
		<p>During the cultivation a minimal distance of the GMO crops and non GMO is mandatory, also, specific
		rules during the cultivation, harvest, storage, and transportation must be followed.
		</p>
  
		<p>Finally, reports are made by the Comité de surveillance biologique du territoire and send to the
		French Parliament to observe the plant health and the consequences of the cultivation of the GMOs.<sup>6,7</sup>
		</p>
  
		<h2>Commercialization:</h2>
  
		<p>Before the import or the export of a GMO, the government must evaluate the potential risk for the
		human health and the environment with the opinion of the Haut Conseil des Biotechnologies. An
		authorization from another EU members or any EU authority can be equivalent to the French
		government approval.<sup>8,9</sup>
		</p>
  
		<h2>Consumption:</h2>
  
		<p>As for the commercialization, a government authorization is needed. Also, GMO food must contain a
		label if the percentage of GMO in the product is superior to 0.9%. On the other hand, a GMO-free
		label can also be put on food that present more than 95% of their ingredient as non-GMO.<sup>10</sup>

		<h1>AGRI-FOOD SECTOR</h1>
		  
		<h2>INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS</h2>
			
		<p>In France, there are very few industrials projects using GMOs due 
		to strict regulation. Most synthetic biology projects use other techniques 
		such as mutagenesis (directed or aleatory), or they used purified 
		compounds extracted from GMOs.
		</p>
              
		<p>On the October 17 2017 the 7th Symposium on Plant Biotechnology, organized 
		by the Scientific Council of the French Association of Plant Biotechnology (AFBV) 
		was held in Paris.
		</p>
              
		<p>Two techniques and label categories were distinguished: GMOs (genetically 
		modified organisms) and GEO (genetically edited organisms). The conclusion 
		was that contemporary French society is more open to the GEO label than the 
		GMO label because of incorrect use of terms by social media which led to the 
		rejection of GMOs. With the positive press surrounding newer techniques such 
		as CRISP-Cas9 and TALEN by PCR mutagenesis (GEO), the general public is more 
		willing to consider genetic engineering of food crops.
		</p>
              
		<p>French research is directed at addressing problems such as:
		</p>
            
		<ul>
			<li><b>Cultivars with high productivity yet requiring fewer inputs</b></li>
			<li><b>Disease resistance</b></li>
			<li><b>Cultivars with specific nutritional value added</b></li>
        </ul>
			  
        <p>To solve these problems researchers are working on several methods using 
		molecular markers, genomic selection, and gene editing.
		</p>
              
		<p>However, these objectives require investment over time and a stable and clear 
		a regulatory framework for market approval at national, regional (European Union)
		, and global levels.
		</p>
              
		<p>France has several companies that work in the synthetic biology field such as 
		Deinove, Le Genopole, Syngenta, Total,  l’INRA, Bayer, and Limagrain to name a few.
		</p>
              
		<p>They are also many controversies about mutagenesis because many people think they 
		are the “hidden iGEM”. Indeed, mutagenesis is different from an organism genetically 
		engineer because with mutagenesis we generate mutations on purpose in a variety of crop 
		in order to develop a specific mutation against a virus, bacteria, bug etc and to “copy” 
		the function of a created part to do a genetically engineered organism.
		</p>
			  
        <p>French regulation follows European Union regulations on GMOs.<sup>1</sup> See the 
		regulation part. France decided to not produce GMOs. Negative media coverage and cultural 
		prejudice against GMOs have made it very difficult to market the products of synthetic 
		biology research.
		</p>
			  
        <p>France’s GMO regulation is directed by the European Commission, which means that 
		all European countries follow the same regulation about GMO regulation, but each county 
		is free to choose if they want to produce GMOs in their country. France voted to forbid 
		GMO production in 2015.
		</p>
              
		<p>The European Academy of Science has stated that “There is compelling evidence that GM 
		crops can contribute to sustainable development goals with benefits to farmers, consumers, 
		the environment and the economy”.<sup>2</sup>We have some perspectives from European 
		countries which allow GMO production:
		</p>
              
		<p>Farmers make important choices every season regarding the various tools they have to 
		produce the best crops. In countries where farmers have the choice, biotech seeds are among 
		those tools. GM crops allow farmers to grow more without using additional land. In addition, 
		crop biotechnology has contributed to significantly reducing the release of greenhouse gas 
		emissions from agricultural practices.
		</p>
              
		<p>In 2014, this was equivalent to removing 22.4 billion kg of carbon dioxide from the 
		atmosphere, or equal to removing 10 million cars from the road for one year.<sup>3</sup>
		</p>
              
		<p>GMO can support food security, economic development, and the environment by improving 
		resistance to pests, weeds, diseases, and developing drought or flood tolerant crops.
		</p>
              
		<p>The European Academy of Science, the World Health Organization, the European Commission 
		and the European Food Safety Authority agreed GM crops are at least as safe as conventional 
		crops improved through selective breeding. In 2000 and 2010, the European Commission released 
		two reports that cover 25 years of research, which concluded that GMOs are just as safe as 
		conventional plants.<sup>4</sup>
		</p>
              
		<p>It is for this reason that France needs active stakeholders and effective communication with 
		the general public in order to address marketing issues and support scientific research and 
		industries to invest more in biotechnologies applications.
		</p>
              
		<p>This is broader context and goal of the Human Practices part of our iGEM project.</p>

        <h2>IGEM PROJECTS</h2>
			  
        <h3>iGEM 2015 - Bordeaux</h3>
			  
        <p>The iGEM 2015 Bordeaux team worked on a project related to vineyard protection 
		against downy mildew. They used Escherichia coli and saw that this microorganism 
		already produces curdlan (polymer of glucose) biosynthesis but they miss one enzyme.
		</p>
              
		<p> After production and purification they sulphated the curdlan and sprayed it on 
		grapevines to protect them against mildew infections. They also won the gold medal.

        <h3>iGEM 2013 - Paris-Saclay</h3>
            
		<p>The team Paris-Saclay in 2013, worked on a project to degrade PCBs (Polychlorinated 
		Biphenyls), ban in France since 1987. This compound is found in electrical equipment 
		is toxic to the environment and humans. Currently, we still find PCBs in the water 
		of la Seine, a major river of commercial importance in France which transits Paris. 
		The team generated a synthetic bacterium that will efficiently biodegrade PCBs. 
		They developed several BioBricks to detect PCB and degrade it.
		</p>
	          
		<p>They won the Gold medal.</p>

        <h1>HEALTH SECTOR</h1>
				
        <h2>INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS</h2>
				  
        <p>A major French synthetic biology research center is the Genopole at Evry.
		</p>
                  
		<p>It is one of the first bioclusters (research center) in France. It is 
		composed of 82 biotechnology companies, 25 shared technology platforms, and 
		19 academic research laboratories, foremost of which is the Institute of Systems 
		& Synthetic Biology. iSSB works on several subjects, one of which is the 
		engineering of cellular components to develop safe GMOs whose in vivo generation 
		and functionality can be strictly controlled and allow new advancements in the 
		biotechnology field.
		</p>
                  
		<p>There are numerous French start-up companies that use synthetic biology to 
		address health issues, such as BGene in Grenoble, and PhageX in Paris.
		</p>
                  
		<p>“Synthetic biology has been identified as a national research priority 
		and innovation strategy due to its strong economic potential in broad application 
		domains (health, environment, energy and materials)”.- Recherche.gouv.fr
		</p>
                  
		<p>France also hosts open access “bio-hacking” labs, such as La Paillasse in Paris, 
		where smaller researcher teams can do DIY (do it yourself) projects. This fosters 
		the development of synthetic biology projects in these sectors and facilitates their 
		transition to the start-up phase without requiring large financial investments.<sup>1</sup>
		 </p>
                  
		<p>France also provides financial and material support to entrepreneurs to create their 
		company and work on projects of direct social impact. However, GMO projects are often not 
		positively evaluated due to current national regulations and are projected to have poor 
		economic viability due to negative social and market perception.
		</p>

        <h2>IGEM PROJECTS</h2>
				  
        <h3>iGEM 2016 - Bordeaux</h3>
				  
        <p>The iGEM 2016 Bordeaux team’s project aimed to innovate sleeping pills with 
		a new molecule called DSIP, a sleep-inducing peptide. They employed techniques such 
		as EpiCRISPR and a photo-inducible system to create a new tool to modify the sleep 
		genes and compare which one is more effective at inducing sleep in Caenorhabditis elegans.
		</p>

        <h3>iGEM 2013 - Evry</h3>
				  
        <p>The 2013 iGEM Evry team worked on a project called “Iron Coli”, in which 
		they created a treatment for hemochromatosis and thalassemia. They used synthetic 
		biology to prevent the intestinal absorption of iron. The used E.coli and 
		engineered the Ferric Uptake Regulation (FUR) pathway so that they can produce 
		iron chelators in response to high concentrations of iron. These engineered bacteria 
		are delivered to the intestine in a polymer capsule. This system is very interesting 
		because it will be less expensive than the existing treatments.
		</p>
            
		<p>They won the gold medal.</p>
