        <h1>Survey analysis: France</h1>
        <p> Total number of answers: 219 (as of 13/10/2017) </p>

        <p> The goal of this survey is to understand the population’s point of view regarding GMOs and our “Softer Shock” iGEM project that intends to use GMOs on crops. This study was made in the context of Human Practices to annotate the interactive map with relevant data.</p>
        <br>
        <p> 12 out of 23 questions were selected for this survey analysis. Below are shown the results related to the public perception of GMOs and our iGEM project. We have benefited from the help of other French teams that have shared the survey to their families and friends.</p>
        <br>
        <p> In France, people have a generally negative view of GMOs. Even if 86% of the population is aware of what a GMO is, still 61% and 78% think it is not safe for health and for environment.</p>
        <br>
        <p> We also notice 13% are uncertain about what a GMO is. This means that a significant proportion of the French population is not sufficiently aware of this subject.  </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Do you know what a GMO is?</h3>
        <div class="centered">

        </div>
        <h3>Do you consider GMOs safe for your health?</h3>
        <div class="centered">
          <img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/3/34/Ionisparis-hp-public_opinion-fr-21.png" width=400>
        </div>
        <h3>Do you consider GMO safe for the environment?</h3>
        <div class="centered">
          <!--Mettre cette image qui suit à droite de celle du dessus--><img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/3/3c/Ionisparis-hp-publicopinion-fr-22.png" width=400>
        </div>
        <p> These 2 results show that people think GMOs are less safe for the environment than for their health.  </p>
        <br>
        <p> Regarding our iGEM project, we wanted to know how concerned people were but also if some specific GMOs application sectors were a real cause for concern. It seems that 55% of our respondents feel worried about GMOs which is in accordance with the health and environment safety answers.   </p>
        <br>
        <h3>What is your degree of preoccupation concerning GMOS?</h3>
        <div class="centered">
          <img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/e/e6/Ionisparis-hp-public_opinion-fr-3.png" width=500>
        </div>
        <p> As shown below, the food and agriculture and environment fields are the main concerns, which are exactly our application domains. We thus know that our product could have difficulty being accepted by the French population.  </p>
        <br>
        <h3> In which sectors are you preoccupied by the eventual presence of GMOs?</h3>
        <div class="centered">
          <img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/thumb/7/75/Ionisparis-hp-public_opinion-fr-4.png/800px-Ionisparis-hp-public_opinion-fr-4.png" width=600>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p> Then, we focused on the people’s investment regarding the support and development of GMOs. There is a majority of negative answers (48%). To investigate the reasons why they were for or against we proposed 2 different answers. For the people involved, we offered them the possibility to select the different domains they were interested in. And for people against, they had to select a reason to their decision.  </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Do you support the use or the development of GMOs?</h3>
        <div class="centered">
          <img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/4/43/Ionisparis-hp-public_opinion-fr-5.png" width=400>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h3>If yes, in which domains? </h3>
        <div class="centered">
          <img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/thumb/a/a2/Ionisparis-hp-public_opinion-fr-6.png/800px-Ionisparis-hp-public_opinion-fr-6.png" width=600>
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> Health is the main domain people are following in terms of GMOs development and use. One hypothesis could be that nowadays the health sector is more developed dealing with GMOs than others. </p>
        <br>
        <p> But as seen below, it is also the highest risk underligned by respondents with environmental risks. Health here is not seen as the application domain but more as the health risks humans can have due to GMOs use. </p>
        <br>
        <h3>If not, why? </h3>
        <div class="centered">
          <img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/thumb/2/29/Ionisparis-hp-public_opinion-fr-7.png/800px-Ionisparis-hp-public_opinion-fr-7.png" width=600>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p> The next part deals directly with our project. The aim was to know if people would agree to use our product in their country to fight climate change. Firstly, we asked them about the climate conditions in their country and if the crops were suffering from global warming. 63% of respondents think France is highly concerned by global warming. </p>
        <br>
        <h3> Do you think agriculture in your country suffers from global warming?</h3>
        <div class="centered">
          <img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/6/60/Ionisparis-hp-public_opinion-fr-8.png" width=400>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p> Secondly, we introduced our project to know if people would accept the use of a GMO product to protect the crops from bad climatic conditions. For this question, the answers were very balanced with 43% of negative feedbacks and 37% of positive feedbacks. </p>
        <br>
        <h3> Would you be in accordance with the use of GMOs on crops in your country to counter the effect of global warming?</h3>
        <div class="centered">
          <img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/e/ec/Ionisparis-hp-public_opinion-fr-9.png" width=400>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p> This comes with the first conclusion we had before, that our product will likely not be accepted in France. </p>
        <br>
        <p>For the last part, we wanted to know if our idea of creating an interactive map on a website would be interesting for people to learn more about GMOs in general. We first wanted to know if the population was interested in improving their knowledge about GMOs in general and the main answer at 65% was yes.  </p>
        <br>
        <h3> Do you wish to know more about GMOs?</h3>
        <div class="centered">
          <img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/0/02/Ionisparis-hp-public_opinion-fr-10.png" width=400>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h3> Which support would be the most relevant to know more about GMOs?</h3>
        <div class="centered">
          <img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/thumb/2/20/Ionisparis-hp-public_opinion-fr-11.png/800px-Ionisparis-hp-public_opinion-fr-11.png" width=600>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p> As shown above, website is the second answer selected as the best support to get more information about GMOs. </p>
        <br>
        <p> In conclusion, our “Softer Shock” product might struggle to find its place in France.  </p>
        <br>
        <p>This may be supported by several results:  </p>
        <br>
        <li> 78% of the population that think GMOs are not safe for the environment </li>
        <li> 144 out of 219 (65.75%) people were concerned by the eventual presence of GMOs in agriculture or environment  </li>
        <br>
        <p> And finally, the 44% of persons against the use of GMOs on crops to protect them from harsh temperatures. </p>
        <br>
        <p> However, our interactive map project is in accordance with the population’s requirements. It meets the needs of 65% people that wish to develop their knowledge about GMOs. </p>
