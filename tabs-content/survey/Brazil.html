        <h1>Survey analysis: Brazil</h1>
        <p> Total number of answers: 102 (as of 13/10/2017) </p>

        <p> The goal of this survey is to understand the population’s point of view regarding GMOs and our “Softer Shock” iGEM project that intends to use GMOs on crops. This study was made in the context of Human Practices to annotate the interactive map with relevant data.</p>
        <br>
        <p> 12 out of 23 questions were selected for this survey analysis. Below are shown the results related to the public perception of GMOs and our iGEM project. We have benefited from the help of other French teams that have shared the survey to their families and friends.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In Brazil people have a global positive view of GMOs. 90% of the population is aware of what a GMO is and 51% think it is safe for health and 38% think it is safe for the environment. Therefore, we may well receive positive feedback for our project implementation in Brazil </p>
        <br>
        <p>We also notice that 32%-33% are uncertain about the safety of GMOs for health and environment. This means that a significant portion of the Brazilian population is not sufficiently informed about these two subjects to make their own opinion. </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Do you know what a GMO is?</h3>
        <div class="centered">

        </div>
        <h3>Do you consider GMOs safe for your health?</h3>
        <div class="centered">

        </div>
        <h3>Do you consider GMO safe for the environment?</h3>
        <div class="centered">
          <!--Mettre cette image qui suit à droite de celle du dessus--><img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/a/ac/Ionisparis-hp-publicopinion-Br-22.png" width=400>
        </div>
        <p> We wanted to know how concerned people were about GMOs in general, and if there were some specific applications that were particularly worrisome. 50% of our respondents felt worried and 10% felt very concerned. This is not exactly in accordance with the previous results but even if people think it is safe to use, there is still a level of concern. </p>
        <br>
        <h3>What is your degree of preoccupation concerning GMOS?</h3>
        <div class="centered">
          <img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/2/2f/Ionisparis-hp-publicopinion-Br-3.png" width=500>
        </div>
        <p> As shown below, the agriculture and environment sector is the main concern of our application domains. We thus know that our product could have difficulty being accepted by the Brazilian population. But since food is not one of the domains people are worried about with GMOs, it has a chance to succeed for the final product, which is wine. </p>
        <br>
        <h3> In which sectors are you preoccupied by the eventual presence of GMOs?</h3>
        <div class="centered">
          <img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/thumb/2/28/Ionisparis-hp-publicopinion-Br-4.png/800px-Ionisparis-hp-publicopinion-Br-4.png" width=600>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p> Then, we focused on the people’s investment regarding the support and development of GMOs. There is a majority of positive answers (78%) and only 6% negative answers. To investigate the reasons why they were for or against we proposed 2 different answers. For the people involved, we offered them the possibility to select the different domains they were interested in. And for people against, they had to select a reason to their decision.  </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Do you support the use or the development of GMOs?</h3>
        <div class="centered">
          <img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/8/82/800px-Ionisparis-hp-publicopinion-Br-5.png" width=400>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h3>If yes, in which domains? </h3>
        <div class="centered">
          <img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/thumb/6/6b/800px-Ionisparis-hp-publicopinion-Br-6.png/800px-800px-Ionisparis-hp-publicopinion-Br-6.png" width=600>
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Agriculture and environment is the main domain people are following in terms of GMOs development and use.  </p>
        <br>
        <p>But as seen below, it is also the highest risk underligned by respondents with health risks. Health, here, is not seen as the application domain but more the health risks human can have due to GMOs uses.  </p>
        <br>
        <h3>If not, why? </h3>
        <div class="centered">
          <img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/thumb/1/1d/800px-800px-Ionisparis-hp-publicopinion-Br-7.png/800px-800px-800px-Ionisparis-hp-publicopinion-Br-7.png" width=600>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p> The next part is directly dealing with our project. The aim was to know if people would agree to use our product in their country to fight climate change. Firstly, in asking them about the climatic conditions in their country and if the crops were suffering from global warming. 81% of the persons think Brazil is highly concerned by global warming effects on crops. </p>
        <br>
        <h3> Do you think agriculture in your country suffers from global warming?</h3>
        <div class="centered">
          <img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/1/1a/800px-800px-800px-Ionisparis-hp-publicopinion-Br-8.png" width=400>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p> Secondly, we introduced our project to know if people would accept the use of a GMO product to protect the crops from bad climatic conditions. For this question, the answers were very divergent with only 6% of negative feedbacks and 75% of positive feedbacks.</p>
        <br>
        <h3> Would you be in accordance with the use of GMOs on crops in your country to counter the effect of global warming?</h3>
        <div class="centered">
          <img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/2/27/800px-800px-800px-Ionisparis-hp-publicopinion-Br-9.png" width=400>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p> This comes with the first conclusion we had before, that our product may well be accepted in Brazil. </p>
        <br>
        <p>For the last part, we wanted to know if our idea of creating an interactive map on a website would be attractive for people to learn more about GMOs in general. We first wanted to know if the population was interested in improving their knowledge about GMOs and the main answer(90%) was yes</p>
        <br>
        <h3> Do you wish to know more about GMOs?</h3>
        <div class="centered">
          <img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/e/e6/800px-800px-800px-Ionisparis-hp-publicopinion-Br-10.png" width=400>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h3> Which support would be the most relevant to know more about GMOs?</h3>
        <div class="centered">
          <img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/thumb/7/70/800px-800px-800px-Ionisparis-hp-publicopinion-Br-11.png/800px-800px-800px-800px-Ionisparis-hp-publicopinion-Br-11.png" width=600>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>As shown above, website is the second answer selected as the best support to get more information about GMOs. </p>
        <br>
        <p>In conclusion, our “Softer Shock” product might succeed to find its place in Brazil.  </p>
        <br>
        <p>This may be supported by several results: </p>
        <br>
        <li>38% of the population think that GMOs are safe for the environment</li>
        <li> 49 out of 102 (48%) people are supporting the development and use of GMOs in agriculture or environment </li>
        <br>
        <p> And finally, the 75% of persons for the use of GMOs on crops to protect them from harsh temperatures. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Moreover, our interactive map project is in accordance with the population’s requirements. It meets the needs of 90% people that wish to develop their knowledge about GMOs. </p>
