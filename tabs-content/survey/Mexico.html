        <h1>Survey analysis: Mexico</h1>

        <p> Total number of answers: 80 (as of 13/10/2017) </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> The goal of this survey is to understand the population’s point of view regarding GMOs and our “Softer Shock” iGEM project that intends to use GMOs on crops. This study was made in the context of Human Practices to annotate the interactive map with relevant data.</p>
        <br>
        <p> 12 out of 23 questions were selected for this survey analysis. Below are shown the results related to the public perception of GMOs and our iGEM project. We have benefited from the help of other French teams that have shared the survey to their families and friends.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In Mexico, people have a global mixed point of view concerning GMOs. 91% of the population is aware of what a GMO is and 54% and 50% think it is not safe for health and for environment, respectively. </p>
        <br>
        <p> We also noticed that 17%-19% are uncertain about the safety of GMOs for health and the environment. This means that a significant proportion of the Mexican population is probably not sufficiently informed about these two subjects. </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Do you know what a GMO is?</h3>

        </div>
        <h3>Do you consider GMOs safe for your health?</h3>
        <div class="centered">

        </div>
        <h3>Do you consider GMO safe for the environment?</h3>
        <div class="centered">
          <!--Mettre cette image qui suit à droite de celle du dessus--><img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/b/bf/Ionisparis-M-hp-public_opinion-22.png" width=400>
        </div>
        <p> Regarding our iGEM project, we wanted to know how concernedpeople were about GMOs but also if some GMOs application sectors were a real cause for concern. It seems that 43% of our respondents do not feel preoccupied versus 9% very preoccupied and 32% preoccupied by GMOs. This is in accordance with the previous results.  the mitigated point of view is demonstrated again. </p>
        <br>
        <h3>What is your degree of preoccupation concerning GMOS?</h3>
        <div class="centered">
          <img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/7/76/Ionisparis-M-hp-public_opinion-3.png" width=500>
        </div>
        <p> As shown below, the food, agriculture, and environment fields are the main concerns which are exactly our application domains. We thus know that our product could have difficulty being accepted by the Mexican population regarding these results. </p>
        <br>
        <h3> In which sectors are you preoccupied by the eventual presence of GMOs?</h3>
        <div class="centered">
          <img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/thumb/b/b1/Ionisparis-M-hp-public_opinion-4.png/800px-Ionisparis-M-hp-public_opinion-4.png" width=600>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p> Then, we focused on the people’s responses regarding the support and development of GMOs. There is a majority of positive answers (75%) and only 11% negative answers. To investigate the reasons why they were for or against we proposed 2 different answers. For the people involved, we offered them the possibility to select the different domains they were interested in. And for people against, they had to select a reason to their decision.  </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Do you support the use or the development of GMOs?</h3>
        <div class="centered">
          <img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/9/9d/Ionispar-hp-po-M-5.png" width=400>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h3>If yes, in which domains? </h3>
        <div class="centered">
          <img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/thumb/9/97/Ionispar-hp-po-M-6.png/800px-Ionispar-hp-po-M-6.png" width=600>
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Agriculture and environment, and Health and food are the main domains people are following in terms of GMOs development and use.  </p>
        <br>
        <p> But as seen below, environmental and health risks are also the highest risks underligned by respondents. Health here is not seen as the application domain but more as the health risks humans can have due to GMOs use. </p>
        <br>
        <h3>If not, why? </h3>
        <div class="centered">
          <img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/thumb/2/26/Ionispar-hp-po-M-7.png/800px-Ionispar-hp-po-M-7.png" width=600>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p> The next part deals directly with our project. The aim was to know if people would agree to use our product in their country to fight climate disorders. Firstly, in asking them about the climatic conditions in their country and if the crops were suffering from global warming. 87% of the persons think Mexico is highly concerned by global warming effects on crops. </p>
        <br>
        <h3> Do you think agriculture in your country suffers from global warming?</h3>
        <div class="centered">
          <img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/1/14/Ionispar-hp-po-M-8.png" width=400>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>Secondly, we introduced our project to know if people would accept the use of a GMO product to protect the crops from bad climate conditions. For this question, the answers were totally opposed with only 10% of people agreeing to use our product and 84% of people disagreeing. </p>
        <br>
        <h3> Would you be in accordance with the use of GMOs on crops in your country to counter the effect of global warming?</h3>
        <div class="centered">
          <img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/2/22/Ionispar-hp-po-M-9.png" width=400>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p> This is very positive for us, it shows that our product will possibly be applicable in Mexico. </p>
        <br>
        <p>For the last part, we wanted to know if our idea of creating an interactive map on a website would be attractive for people to learn more about GMOs in general. We first wanted to know if the population was interested in improving their knowledge about GMOs and the main answer at 61% was yes.</p>
        <br>
        <h3> Do you wish to know more about GMOs?</h3>
        <div class="centered">
          <img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/9/99/Ionispar-hp-po-M-10.png" width=400>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h3> Which support would be the most relevant to know more about GMOs?</h3>
        <div class="centered">
          <img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/thumb/d/d2/Ionispar-hp-po-M-11.png/800px-Ionispar-hp-po-M-11.png" width=600>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>As shown above, website is the third answer selected, after media and conference, as the best support to get more information about GMOs. </p>
        <br>
        <p> In conclusion, our “Softer Shock” product acceptance in Mexico would be moderate. </p>
        <br>
        <p>This may be supported by several results: </p>
        <br>
        <li>50% of the population think that GMOs are not safe for the environment </li>
        <li> 45 out of 80 (56%) people supporting the development and use of GMOs in agriculture or environment  </li>
        <br>
        <p> And finally, the 84% of persons voting for the use of GMOs on crops to protect them from harsh temperatures. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Moreover, our interactive map project is in accordance with the population’s requirements. It meets the needs of 90% people that wish to develop their knowledge about GMOs. </p>
