		<h1>Survey analysis: Mexico</h1>

		<p> Total number of answers: 80 (as of 13/10/2017) 
		</p>

		<p> The goal of this survey is to understand the population’s point of view regarding GMOs and our “Softer Shock” iGEM project that intends to use GMOs on crops. This study was made in the context of Human Practices to annotate the interactive map with relevant data.
		</p>

		<p> 12 out of 23 questions were selected for this survey analysis. Below are shown the results related to the public perception of GMOs and our iGEM project. We have benefited from the help of other French teams that have shared the survey to their families and friends.
		</p>

		<p>In Mexico, people have a global mixed point of view concerning GMOs. 91% of the population is aware of what a GMO is and 54% and 50% think it is not safe for health and for environment, respectively. 
		</p>

		<p> We also noticed that 17%-19% are uncertain about the safety of GMOs for health and the environment. This means that a significant proportion of the Mexican population is probably not sufficiently informed about these two subjects. 
		</p>

		<h3>Do you know what a GMO is?</h3>
 
		<img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/e/e6/Ionisparis-M-hp-public_opinion-1.png"/>

		<h3>Do you consider GMOs safe for your health?</h3>
 
		<img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/4/4e/Ionisparis-M-hp-public_opinion-21.png"/>
 
		<h3>Do you consider GMO safe for the environment?</h3>

		<!--Mettre cette image qui suit à droite de celle du dessus--><img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/b/bf/Ionisparis-M-hp-public_opinion-22.png"/>

		<p> Regarding our iGEM project, we wanted to know how concernedpeople were about GMOs but also if some GMOs application sectors were a real cause for concern. It seems that 43% of our respondents do not feel preoccupied versus 9% very preoccupied and 32% preoccupied by GMOs. This is in accordance with the previous results.  the mitigated point of view is demonstrated again. 
		</p>

		<h3>What is your degree of preoccupation concerning GMOS?</h3>

		<img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/7/76/Ionisparis-M-hp-public_opinion-3.png"/>

		<p> As shown below, the food, agriculture, and environment fields are the main concerns which are exactly our application domains. We thus know that our product could have difficulty being accepted by the Mexican population regarding these results. 
		</p>

		<h3> In which sectors are you preoccupied by the eventual presence of GMOs?</h3>

		<img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/thumb/b/b1/Ionisparis-M-hp-public_opinion-4.png/800px-Ionisparis-M-hp-public_opinion-4.png"/>

		<p> Then, we focused on the people’s responses regarding the support and development of GMOs. There is a majority of positive answers (75%) and only 11% negative answers. To investigate the reasons why they were for or against we proposed 2 different answers. For the people involved, we offered them the possibility to select the different domains they were interested in. And for people against, they had to select a reason to their decision.  
		</p>
 
		<h3>Do you support the use or the development of GMOs?</h3>
  
		<img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/9/9d/Ionispar-hp-po-M-5.png"/>

		<h3>If yes, in which domains? </h3>

		<img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/thumb/9/97/Ionispar-hp-po-M-6.png/800px-Ionispar-hp-po-M-6.png"/>

		<p>Agriculture and environment, and Health and food are the main domains people are following in terms of GMOs development and use.  
		</p>

		<p> But as seen below, environmental and health risks are also the highest risks underligned by respondents. Health here is not seen as the application domain but more as the health risks humans can have due to GMOs use. 
		</p>

		<h3>If not, why? </h3>

		<img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/thumb/2/26/Ionispar-hp-po-M-7.png/800px-Ionispar-hp-po-M-7.png"/>

		<p> The next part deals directly with our project. The aim was to know if people would agree to use our product in their country to fight climate disorders. Firstly, in asking them about the climatic conditions in their country and if the crops were suffering from global warming. 87% of the persons think Mexico is highly concerned by global warming effects on crops. </p>

		<h3> Do you think agriculture in your country suffers from global warming?</h3>
  
		<img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/1/14/Ionispar-hp-po-M-8.png"/>

		<p>Secondly, we introduced our project to know if people would accept the use of a GMO product to protect the crops from bad climate conditions. For this question, the answers were totally opposed with only 10% of people agreeing to use our product and 84% of people disagreeing. 
		</p>

		<h3> Would you be in accordance with the use of GMOs on crops in your country to counter the effect of global warming?</h3>

		<img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/2/22/Ionispar-hp-po-M-9.png"/>

		<p> This is very positive for us, it shows that our product will possibly be applicable in Mexico. 
		</p>
 
		<p>For the last part, we wanted to know if our idea of creating an interactive map on a website would be attractive for people to learn more about GMOs in general. We first wanted to know if the population was interested in improving their knowledge about GMOs and the main answer at 61% was yes.
		</p>

		<h3> Do you wish to know more about GMOs?</h3>

		<img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/9/99/Ionispar-hp-po-M-10.png"/>

		<h3> Which support would be the most relevant to know more about GMOs?</h3>

		<img src="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/thumb/d/d2/Ionispar-hp-po-M-11.png/800px-Ionispar-hp-po-M-11.png"/>
 
		<p>As shown above, website is the third answer selected, after media and conference, as the best support to get more information about GMOs. 
		</p>

		<p> In conclusion, our “Softer Shock” product acceptance in Mexico would be moderate. 
		</p>

		<p>This may be supported by several results: 
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>50% of the population think that GMOs are not safe for the environment </li>
			<li> 45 out of 80 (56%) people supporting the development and use of GMOs in agriculture or environment  </li>
		</ul>
  
		<p> And finally, the 84% of persons voting for the use of GMOs on crops to protect them from harsh temperatures. 
		</p>
  
		<p>Moreover, our interactive map project is in accordance with the population’s requirements. It meets the needs of 90% people that wish to develop their knowledge about GMOs. 
		</p>

    <div class="regulation">
	
		<h1>Mexico</h1>
  
		<p>Mexico cultivates 0.1 million of hectares of GMO crops in 2016 and 158 approved GMO for human
		consumption.<sup>1</sup> The major legislation of the country about GMO is the <b>Law on Biosecurity of
		Genetically Modified Organisms</b>. This regulation provides rules on the research, release,
		commercialization, exportation and importation of GMOs, and ensures the correct level of safety for
		each product.<sup>2</sup>
		</p>
  
		<p>Also, to prevent the risk of a potential release of GMO in the environment, an international
		convention has been made that leads to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety on 2000. This protocol
		can help countries to have a basis regulation and methodology for modified organisms, to harmonize
		the regulation on biosafety on an international level, and a mechanism for international information
		exchange on biosafety.<sup>3,4</sup> Mexico ratified the Cartagena protocol on 2002.<sup>5</sup>
		</p>
  
		<h2>Research:</h2>
  
		<p>To practice research on GMOs, an application from the ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of
		Environment and Natural Resources is required.<sup>6</sup>
		</p>
  
		<h2>Cultivation:</h2>
  
		<p>To cultivate GMOs, the Mexico’s Departments of Environment and Agriculture must approve the
		experimental data and a risk study containing:
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>The identification of the characteristics of the GMO that can be a risk for the biological
			diversity</li>
			<li>An evaluation of the consequences of the materialization of the risk</li>
			<li>An estimation of the GMO to be a potential global risk</li>
			<li>Strategies to manage the risk of propagation and a part indicating if those risks are
			acceptable or manageable<sup>6,7</sup></li>
		</ul>
	
		<h2>Commercialization:</h2>
  
		<p>To commercialize GMOs in the country, a risk assessment is required with information about the
		GMO. Then, the ministry of Agriculture and the ministry of Environment and Natural Resources can
		give a permit if the GMO is considered as safe for the environment and for human health. If the GMO
		is dedicated to human consumption, an authorization of the ministry of Health is required too. Finally
		a label indicating that the product is a GMO, its genetically acquired characteristics, its special
		requirements for its cultivation, and changes in reproductive capabilities is necessary.<sup>8,9</sup>
		</p>
  
		<h2>Consumption:</h2>
  
		<p>GMO food for human consumption is legal in Mexico, but an authorization of the Mexico’s
		Department of Health is required. To have it, a study of the risks for the human health is needed and
		if no evidence of risks are found, the product can be sold. The product need to have a label indicating
		its GMO origin, and its nutritional value and ingredients if these characteristics are significantly
		different from conventional products.<sup>9</sup>

		<h1>AGRI-FOOD SECTOR</h1>
		  
		<h2>INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS</h2>
			
		<p>Mexico has been planting biotech crops since 1996, and is one of the six 
		pioneer with USA, Brazil, Canada, India and Argentina and biotech planting 
		countries.<sup>1</sup>
		</p>
              
		<p>Since 1996, Mexico had 158 approvals for GMOs food cultivars and feed use.
		</p>
              
		<p>In 2016 Mexico planted 101,000 hectares of biotech crops, down from 141,000 
		hectares in 2015. The 101,000 hectares are cotton and soybean, cotton being one 
		of the most important GMO crop grown in Mexico.<sup>1</sup>
		</p>
              
		<p>However, there are still negative propaganda and cultural prejudices that opponents 
		use to confuse the public about the technology, it happens the same in other countries 
		such as France.
		</p>
              
		<p>In conclusion, to increase biotech projects in Mexico we need involved stakeholders 
		and effective communication with the general public in order to address marketing issues 
		and support scientific research and industrial investment in applications of biotechnology.
		</p>
              
		<p>Currently, a few companies in Mexico are demonstrating some of the practical possibilities 
		that synthetic biology can offers:<sup>1</sup>
		</p>
              
		<ul>
			<li><b>The National Institute of Forestry, Agriculture and 
			Livestock Research (INIFAP)</b> has developed GMO beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) 
			with resistance to fungi Colletorichum lindemuthianum, Fusarium lateritium and 
			Rhizoctonia solani. The beans were tested in Celaya, Guanajuato after a permit 
			for experimental release was granted in 2014.</li>
			<li><b>The International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center 
			(CIMMYT)</b> have tested experimental releases of GM wheat over the last seven 
			years with various traits including drought tolerance.</li>
			<li><b>The National Laboratory of Genomics for Biodiversity 
			(LANGEBIO), Advanced Studies (CINVESTAV) and a private company</b> are 
			developing biotech crops that will absorb and optimize the use of phosphorus.</li>
			<li><b>CINVESTAV</b> is also developing a GMO lemon tree 
			(Citrus aurantifolia) resistant to the disease known as Huanglongbing (HLB) which 
			causes losses of lemon crops each year.</li>
        </ul>
			  
        <p>Biotechnology in the environmental sector is very beneficial for Mexico;
		</p>
              
		<p>Since 1996, biotech cotton farmers from Chihuahua have saved 30 percent on 
		their production costs due to reduced pesticide use, going from 18 applications 
		per growing season to just one.<sup>2</sup>
		</p>
              
		<p>Biotech improvements to soybean and cotton are estimated to have increased 
		Mexican revenues by US$489 million from 1996 to 2015. The profits alone for 2015 
		are estimated at US$77 million (Brookes and Barfoot).
		</p>

        <h2>IGEM PROJECTS</h2>
			  
        <h3>iGEM 2010 - Tec-Monterrey</h3>
			  
        <p>The iGEM 2010 Tec-Monterrey team from Mexico developed a new concentrated 
		bacterial sensor using genetically modified microorganisms. Using genetic 
		engineering has resulted in more sophisticated bacterial reporters that 
		will be capable of detecting more easily the presence of contaminants, sugars 
		and amino acids in different media such as soil and water.

        <h1>HEALTH SECTOR</h1>
				
        <h2>INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS</h2>
				  
        <p>In October 2009, Mexican researchers and companies directors discussed 
		about the future development of applied synthetic biology, reaching two 
		main conclusions. First, Mexico is is relatively late in examining these 
		issues. Secondly, the research directions that would allow Mexico to be 
		competitive were not clearly defined. 
		<a target= "_blank" href="http://www.biosintetica.mx">http://www.biosintetica.mx</a>
		</p>
                  
		<p>Since then Mexico has seen the formation of associations such as 
		<a target= "_blank" href="http://www.biosintetica.mx">Biosintetica</a> 
		to promote synthetic biology research and technological 
		development in the Mexican academic and industrial sectors.
		</p>
                  
		<p>Despite this, Mexico has made important contributions to synthetic biology.
		</p>
                  
		<p>In 1980, the Mexican scientist Francisco Bolivar Zapata was able to access 
		the DNA of a pancreatic cell and from there obtained the gene that encodes insulin. 
		</p>
                  
		<p>Thanks to the isolation of this gene, it could be inserted into a vector 
		called pBR 322. The vector and the insert were incorporated into a recombinant 
		bacterium. Subsequently they were put into a fermentation tank and with this 
		it was possible the unlimited reproduction of the high purity insulin.
		</p>
                  
		<p>Current Mexican synthetic biology projects:
		</p>
                  
		<p>In general, no established companies use genetic engineering in the 
		health sector.<sup>3</sup>
		</p>
           
		<p>However, several Mexican universities have departments that work with 
		synthetic biology such as:
		</p>
                  
		<ul>
			<li><b>The center of research CINVESTAV</b> 
			in Irapuato has a department of genetic engineering  active in several 
			health sector applications of synthetic biology.<sup>4</sup></li>
			<li><b>“Red synbioMX”</b> is The National 
			Synthetic Biology Network of Mexico. It is presented as a web page made 
			from a collective effort of researchers and students working in synthetic 
			biology in Mexico and abroad. It is an non-profit interface with the goal 
			of keeping the Mexican society informed about synthetic biology news.<sup>5</sup></li>
        </ul>

        <p>For example, a group of graduate students from the National Polytechnic Institute 
		in Guanajuato created GATCorp which is the first start-up of synthetic biology in Mexico. 
		The purpose of GATCorp is to incorporate biotechnological processes in the natural and 
		chemical products’ industry in Mexico.<sup>6</sup>
		</p>
                  
		<p>Red synbioMX has the goal of popularizing synthetic biology through activities, 
		lectures and conferences to unite all sectors that work on synthetic biology. For 
		more information and the latest news about synthetic biology projects in Mexico, 
		visit their <a target= "_blank" href="https://synbiomx.org/">web page</a>.
		</p>
                  
		<ul>
			<li><b>“Bread for all”</b>developed in Spain and 
			Mexico,is a project in the health sector that is being developed to find 
			wheat varieties for people allergic to gluten.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Celiac disease, or "gluten intolerance", affects 1% of consumers. The 
		recent CRISPR / Cas9 technique offers the hope of being able to modify the 
		epitopes involved in celiac disease and to lead to acceptable varieties, 
		that is to say to low levels of gliadins guilty of allergies, and thus to be 
		consumed by the sick. Trials are under way for 10 and 20 people with celiac 
		disease respectively.<sup>7</sup>
		</p>
                  
		<p>They have a SynthechBio Network made by reserachers that supports biohacking 
		and do it yourself-biology initiatives (DIY-Bio). SynthechBio has been 
		communicating and organizing activities in several South American countries 
		such as Peru, Argentina and Brazil to promote synthetic biology.<sup>8</sup>

		<h2>IGEM PROJECTS</h2>
               
		<h3>iGEM 2014 - ITESM-CEM Mexico</h3>
                
		<p>The iGEM 2014 ITESM-CEM team from Mexico worked on a preventive gene therapy 
		for atherosclerosis using microbial enzymes. This project was motivated by the 
		fact that the human body is unable to degrade many substances that affect our 
		health and so these substances start to accumulate slowly and finally reduce our 
		lifespan. They try to build a system using synthetic biology to degrade oxidized 
		cholesterol. They also did several talks and courses about their project, about 
		molecular and synthetic biology, and the positive impacts they could have on society.
