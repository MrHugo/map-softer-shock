		<h1>Spain</h1>
  
		<p>Spain is one of the biggest producer of GMO crops in the EU with 0.1 million of hectares of biotech
		crops in 2016.<sup>1</sup> As a member of the European Union, Spain is strongly affected by the EU rules, the
		first one being the directive <b>2001/18/EC</b>, which regulates the release of GMO on the environment
		and the regulation <b>(EC) No 1829/2003</b>, which defines the modified feed and food that can be placed
		on the market and can be consumed.<sup>2</sup> Moreover, a national law (<b>Law 9/2003</b> and the <b>royal decree
		178/2004</b>) was also voted to provide other restrictions on GMOs. These laws led to the creation of
		the National Biosafety Commission and the Inter-Ministerial Council for Genetically Modified
		Organisms.<sup>3</sup>
		</p>
  
		<p>Also, to prevent the risk of a potential release of GMO in the environment, international convention
		has been made that leads to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety on 2000. This protocol can help
		countries to have a basis regulation and methodology for modified organisms, to harmonize the
		regulation on biosafety on an international level, and a mechanism for international information
		exchange on biosafety.<sup>4,5</sup> Spain ratified the Cartagena protocol on 2002.<sup>6</sup>
		</p>
  
		<h2>Research:</h2>
  
		<p>To practice research on biotechnology, an authorization of the National Biosafety Commission is
		needed. If the experiments take place at a national level, an authorization of the Inter-Ministerial
		Council for Genetically Modified Organisms is also required.<sup>7</sup>
		</p>
  
		<h2>Cultivation:</h2>
  
		<p>To cultivate GMOs an authorization of the National Biosafety Commission and the Inter-Ministerial
		Council for Genetically Modified Organisms is necessary, specific equipment is needed to cultivate,
		transport, store the crops, and a minimum distance of 220 meters is necessary between GMO and
		non-GMO crops. Before the beginning of the production, the neighborhood and the local authorities
		must be notified of the future GMO crops.
		</p>
	
		<p>Also, rapports must be send to the ministry of environment by the company, the National Biosafety
		Commission and the Inter-Ministerial Council for Genetically Modified Organisms to keep track of the
		location of the GMO and their effects on the environment.<sup>8,9</sup>
		</p>
  
		<h2>Commercialization:</h2>
  
		<p>To commercialize GMOs, an authorization of the National Biosafety Commission and the Inter-Ministerial Council for Genetically Modified Organisms. Only the GMOs approved by the EU can be
		imported.</br>
		Once the GMO receive the authorization to be commercialized, the product is labelled in function of
		the European law. If the final product contains more than 0.9% of GMO food, the product must be
		labelled as GMO product.<sup>7,10</sup>
		</p>
  
		<h2>Consumption:</h2>
  
		<p>The consumption of GMO food in Spain follows the European law. Only products that are granted by
		the European Union as safe for the human health and environment can be bought.<sup>7</sup>
		</p>

        <h2>INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS</h2>
			
        <p>1998: Spain started using GM maize.
		</p>
              
		<p>Since then, Spain has qualified as one of the 18 biotech “mega-countries” 
		growing more than 50,000 hectares.<sup>1</sup>
		</p>
              
		<p>Spain remains one of the few EU countries that allows the use of GM crops 
		and has become the highest yielding producer in EU.
		</p>
              
		<p>The autonomous regions of Aragon and Catalonia had the largest share of 
		biotech maize (70%) of Spain’s total biotech maize plantings, as the corn borer 
		insect is endemic in these areas.
		</p>
              
		<p>Today, some companies in Spain are demonstrating the possibilities that synthetic 
		biology can offer through fundamental and applied research projects:
		</p>
              
		<ul>
			<li>In Madrid,<b>the CSIC (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones 
			Científicas)</b> built a research center called “CNB” (Centro Nacional de 
			Biotechnologia) in 1992. Many prestigious Spanish researcher work in this center 
			on several projects in synthetic biology such as Victor de Lorenzo who is one of 
			the main drivers of synthetic biology in Spain.<sup>2</sup></li>
        </ul>
			  
        <p>They are developing multiple biological agents for biosensing, remediation, and 
		transformation of urban and industrial chemical waste that is dumped into the environment.
		</p>
              
		<p>One of the tools they use is the bacterium Pseudomonas putida, easy to work with 
		and a reliable chassis for implantation of genetic and metabolic circuits.
		</p>
              
		<p>Perspectives for the future <sup>3</sup>:
		</p>
              
		<ul>
			<li><b>BioCassava Plus Project:</b> 
			Improve the nutritional qualities of cassava.</li>
			<li><b>Africa Biofortified Sorghum Project:</b> 
			Develop a more nutritious and easily digestible sorghum that contains 
			increased levels of amino acids, vitamins, iron and zinc. Sorghum is 
			the fifth most important cereal crop and the main dietary staple for more 
			than 500 million people.</li>
			<li><b>Water Efficient Maize for Africa (WEMA) 
			Project:</b> Developing drought-tolerant maize, a staple that more 
			that more 300 million Africans depend on as their main food source.</li>
        </ul>
			  
        <p>How does synthetic biology impact Spain?<sup>4</sup>
		</p>
              
		<ul>
			<li>Economic benefits or farmers due to higher yields and a lower cost of inputs.</li>
            <li>Water savings equivalent to the use of almost 750.000 citizens.</li>
            <li>Farmers margins improved by up to 147 € per hectare.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>IGEM PROJECTS</h2>
			  
        <h3>iGEM 2013 - Valencia-CIPF</h3>
			  
        <p>In 2013, the iGEM team Valencia-CIPF worked on developing a device to create an 
		organism capable of repelling insects.
		</p> 
			  
		<p>This device will be used in areas of Africa, Asia, and the Americas that suffer 
		from diseases like malaria, sleeping sickness or cholera.
		</p>
              
		<p>They used the properties of monoterpenes from <i>Arabodpsis thaliana</i> 
		(able to repel some insects) and the S-linalool synthase gene from <i>Clarkia 
		breweri</i>, responsible for the aroma. They introduce the gene responsible 
		inside a yeast so that the repellent would always be expressed.

        <h3>iGEM 2016 - UPO_SEVILLLA</h3>
			  
        <p>The iGEM 2016 team UPO SEVILLA, worked on a project to eliminate 
		glycerol from the environment by using it as a carbon source for bacteria. 
		The microorganism they used was <i>Pseudomonas putida</i>, capable of adhering 
		to a substrate and aggregating to form communities or biofilms. Their goal 
		was to produce compounds that are beneficial for human beings. They 
		genetically manipulate <i>P. putida</i> to increase glycerol assimilation and 
		to control formation and dispersal of biofilms.

        <h1>HEALTH SECTOR</h1>

        <h2>INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS</h2>
				  
        <p>Nowadays, some companies in Spain are doing projects to show 
		the possibilities that synthetic biology can offer in the health 
		sector through projects:
		</p>
                  
		<ul>
			<li><u>Victor Lorenzo</u> is working in the development of an 
			artificial immune system using synthetic biology at the CNB.<sup>1</sup></br>
			Scientists say that artificial bacteria will be able to reprogram 
			stem cells and regenerate all types of tissues or damaged organs, 
			so they can instantly detect and treat tumour cells.<sup>2</sup></li>
			<li><u>Francis Mojica</u> researcher at the University of Alicante, 
				who discovered that bacteria use a method to develop immunity that 
				opened the door to revolution in genetic manipulation. He discovered 
				the CRISPR-Cas9 system.
				The technique, today worth billions of dollars, came from the 
				study of microbes in Santa Pola.</li>
		</ul>
		
        <p>This year, genetic testing will be tested against diseases such as 
		cancer or HIV in Spain.
		 </p>
                  
		<ul>
			<li>The Research Group on Synthesis of active principles and chemistry 
			of steroids at the University of Valladolid (UVa), led by <u>Professor 
			Alfonso Pérez Encabo</u> works on developing new products and new 
			synthetic routes using steroids for the the pharmaceutical industry.<sup>3</sup></li>
			<li><u>Ricard Solé</u> principal investigator of the University Pompeu 
			Fabra (UPF), proposes the use of synthetic biology to counteract the 
			anthropogenic effects on our planet through the design of bacteria that 
			degrade plastic polymers. <sup>4</sup></li>
			<li>Wheat varieties for people allergic to gluten "Bread for all" is an 
			other project developed in Spain and Mexico.</li>
        </ul>
				  
        <p>Celiac disease, or "gluten intolerance", affects 1% of consumers. The 
		recent CRISPR / Cas9 technique offers the hope of being able to modify the 
		epitopes involved in celiac disease and to lead to acceptable varieties, that 
		is to say to low levels of gliadins guilty of allergies, and thus to be consumed 
		by the sick. Trials are under way for 10 and 20 people with celiac disease 
		respectively.<sup>5</sup>
		</p>
                  
		<p>They have two main approaches to designing microorganisms:<sup>6</sup>
		</p>
                  
		<ol>
            <li> Modification of existing organisms and the creation of 
			a dependence between them necessary to survive (obligate mutualism). 
			This strategy could make it possible to avoid the transition to a desert 
			state in arid ecosystems (40% of the planet's ecosystems).</li>
            <li> Design of organisms capable of surviving in a specific substrate, 
			such as industrial waste. Proper design would allow these organisms to 
			be viable only in these artificial media.</li>
        </ol>
				  
        <p>The same group is working on biological computers, groups of genetically 
		modified cells that act in part following conventional binary logic but with 
		a design that moves away from both electronics and biological designs. This 
		could permit applications related to "intelligent" biosensors or the creation 
		of diagnostic kits, for example.
		</p>

        <h2>IGEM PROJECTS</h2>
				  
        <h3>iGEM 2016 - UPF-CRG Barcelona</h3>
				  
        <p>The team UPF-CRG from Barcelona, performed in 2016 a project in developing 
		a probiotic that could reduce the amount of polyamines that our body absorb. 
		These polyamines in high concentrations are responsible of in a long term increase 
		the probabilities of developing cancer, they are found in processed meats among other dishes.
		</p>
                  
		<p>Their probiotic will consist of a mix of different modified bacteria that 
		will simply process the excess part of polyamines from the digestion and eliminate 
		them using a set of natural enzymes also found in our bodies. The probiotic will be 
		consumed as an oral pill. They had also planned to develop a cancer risk detector 
		by engineering a bacterial cell. In that case they will use the acetylated version 
		of polyamines that have been targeted in previous studies to have a high success 
		in both sensibility and specificity of cancer risk detection.

        <h3>iGEM 2011 - UPO_SEVILLA</h3>
				  
        <p>The team UPO from Sevilla, developed in 2011, molecular systems 
		that reproduce an electronic flip-flop (a device that switches between 
		two different states (0 to 1) allowing the construction of living memory 
		devices closer to the robustness of informatics. The idea came from prior 
		iGEM teams, so they took their system and improved it by constructing 
		different regulation levels in a different model organisms such as bacteria 
		or yeast. They won a prize for the Best Human Practice project in Europe 
		in which they created a Spanish web page to communicate about synthetic 
		biology in Spain.
