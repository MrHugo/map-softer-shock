    <h1>USA regulation</h1>
  <p>The United State are the major GMOs producer with 72.9 million of hectares of biotech crops in
    2016.<sup>1</sup> This position is explained by the specific regulation of the country, the Coordinated
    Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology, published in 1986 which focus on the nature of the
    product and not on its fabrication. So, the regulation of the United States is favorable on the
    development of the GMOs in the country and they are globally treated as normal products. The US
    Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service regulates GMO plants, the
    Food and Drug Administration regulates GMOs in food, drugs or biological product and the
    Environmental Protection Agency regulates GMOs on pesticides.<sup>2</sup>

  <p>The United States did not sign any international protocol on biosafety.

              <p>Since 1996, genetically modified seeds have been available in the United States. Currently, genetically modified maize, soybean and cotton crops are the overwhelming majority of crops.<sup>1</sup>
              </p>
              <p> Nowadays, many companies in USA are working on synthetic biology to performing the nutritional value of crops. Recently, Rutgers scientist discovered a way to reduce animal feed and food production costs by increasing a key nutrient in corn. They found an efficient way to enhance the nutritional value of corn by inserting a bacterial gene that causes it to produce a key nutrient called methionine. This new discovery could benefit millions of people in developing countries but also for the reducing worldwide animal feed costs.<sup>2</sup>
