        <h1>France</h1>
        <p>
          France is one of the most restrictive country regarding the GMO. As a member of the European
          Union, France is strongly affected by the EU rules, the first one is the directive <b>2001/18/EC</b>, that
          regulates the release of GMO on the environment and the regulation <b>(EC) No 1829/2003</b>, that
          defines the modified feed and food that can be placed on the market and can be consumed.<sup>1</sup>
          Moreover, a national law (<b>Loi 2008-595 du 25 juin 2008</b>) was also voted to provide other restrictions
          on GMOs. This law also created a high council called the Haut Conseil des Biotechnologies that will
          discuss the risk of the GMO for the environment and the human health.<sup>2</sup>
        </p>
        <p>Also, to prevent the risk of a potential release of GMO in the environment, an international convention has been made that leads to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety on 2000. This protocol can help countries to have a basis regulation and methodology for modified organisms, to harmonize the regulation on biosafety on an international level, and a mechanism for international information exchange on biosafety.<sup>3,4</sup> China ratified the Cartagena protocol on 2005.<sup>5</sup>
        </p>
        <h2>Research:</h2>
        <p>If the GMO is considered as safe for the environment or the public health, a declaration to the
          government must be done before the beginning of the test. At the contrary, if the organism may be a
          potential risk, an authorization of the research ministry is needed with the opinion of the Haut
          Conseil des Biotechnologies.<sup>6</sup>
        </p>
        <h2>Cultivation:</h2>
        <p>To cultivate GMOs, an authorization of the environment ministry is required with an evaluation of
          the Haut Conseil des Biotechnologies to determine if the organism can present risk for the human
          health or for the environment. Also the public needs to be informed about the future cultivation
          through a website and the local authorities of the area must have advanced notice.
        </p>
        <p>During the cultivation a minimal distance of the GMO crops and non GMO is mandatory, also, specific
          rules during the cultivation, harvest, storage, and transportation must be followed.
        </p>
        <p>Finally, reports are made by the Comit√© de surveillance biologique du territoire and send to the
          French Parliament to observe the plant health and the consequences of the cultivation of the GMOs.<sup>6,7</sup>
        </p>
        <h2>Commercialization:</h2>
        <p>Before the import or the export of a GMO, the government must evaluate the potential risk for the
          human health and the environment with the opinion of the Haut Conseil des Biotechnologies. An
          authorization from another EU members or any EU authority can be equivalent to the French
          government approval.<sup>8,9</sup></p>
          <h2>Consumption:</h2>
          <p>As for the commercialization, a government authorization is needed. Also, GMO food must contain a
            label if the percentage of GMO in the product is superior to 0.9%. On the other hand, a GMO-free
            label can also be put on food that present more than 95% of their ingredient as non-GMO.<sup>10</sup>
