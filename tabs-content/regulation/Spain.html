        <h1>Spain</h1>
        <p>Spain is one of the biggest producer of GMO crops in the EU with 0.1 million of hectares of biotech
          crops in 2016.<sup>1</sup> As a member of the European Union, Spain is strongly affected by the EU rules, the
          first one being the directive <b>2001/18/EC</b>, which regulates the release of GMO on the environment
          and the regulation <b>(EC) No 1829/2003</b>, which defines the modified feed and food that can be placed
          on the market and can be consumed.<sup>2</sup> Moreover, a national law (<b>Law 9/2003</b> and the <b>royal decree
            178/2004</b>) was also voted to provide other restrictions on GMOs. These laws led to the creation of
            the National Biosafety Commission and the Inter-Ministerial Council for Genetically Modified
            Organisms.<sup>3</sup>
          </p>
          <p>Also, to prevent the risk of a potential release of GMO in the environment, international convention
            has been made that leads to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety on 2000. This protocol can help
            countries to have a basis regulation and methodology for modified organisms, to harmonize the
            regulation on biosafety on an international level, and a mechanism for international information
            exchange on biosafety.<sup>4,5</sup> Spain ratified the Cartagena protocol on 2002.<sup>6</sup>
          </p>
          <h2>Research:</h2>
          <p>To practice research on biotechnology, an authorization of the National Biosafety Commission is
            needed. If the experiments take place at a national level, an authorization of the Inter-Ministerial
            Council for Genetically Modified Organisms is also required.<sup>7</sup>
            <h2>Cultivation:</h2>
            <p>To cultivate GMOs an authorization of the National Biosafety Commission and the Inter-Ministerial
              Council for Genetically Modified Organisms is necessary, specific equipment is needed to cultivate,
              transport, store the crops, and a minimum distance of 220 meters is necessary between GMO and
              non-GMO crops. Before the beginning of the production, the neighborhood and the local authorities
              must be notified of the future GMO crops.</p>
              <p>Also, rapports must be send to the ministry of environment by the company, the National Biosafety
                Commission and the Inter-Ministerial Council for Genetically Modified Organisms to keep track of the
                location of the GMO and their effects on the environment.<sup>8,9</sup>
              </p>
              <h2>Commercialization:</h2>
              <p>To commercialize GMOs, an authorization of the National Biosafety Commission and the Inter-
                Ministerial Council for Genetically Modified Organisms. Only the GMOs approved by the EU can be
                imported.</br>
                Once the GMO receive the authorization to be commercialized, the product is labelled in function of
                the European law. If the final product contains more than 0.9% of GMO food, the product must be
                labelled as GMO product.<sup>7,10</sup>
              </p>
              <h2>Consumption:</h2>
              <p>The consumption of GMO food in Spain follows the European law. Only products that are granted by
                the European Union as safe for the human health and environment can be bought.<sup>7</sup>
