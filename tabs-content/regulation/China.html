        <h1>China</h1>
        <p>
          China is one of the most important producer of GMO in the world with a surface of 2.8 million of
          hectares of GM crops in 2016 and the production of 60 GMOs species.<sup>1</sup> Actually, China doesn’t have a
          specific law to regulate GMOs in the country, but biotechnology is considered as an emerging sector
          of strategic importance. That is why the State Council and the Ministry of Agriculture enacted
          multiple law on the testing, production, and marketing of GMOs.<sup>2</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, to prevent the risk of a potential release of GMO in the environment, an international
          convention has been made that leads to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety on 2000. This protocol
          can help countries to have a basis regulation and methodology for modified organisms, to harmonize
          the regulation on biosafety on an international level, and a mechanism for international information
          exchange on biosafety.<sup>3,4</sup> China ratified the Cartagena protocol on 2005.<sup>5</sup>
        </p>
        <h2>Research:</h2>
        <p>
          To performed research on GMOs, the laboratory need an authorization from the National Biosafety
          Committee, further approval are not necessary unless the GMO is classified as a class III or class IV
          level of biosafety.<sup>6</sup>
        </p>
        <h2>Cultivation:</h2>
        <p>
          To start the cultivation of a GMO, an application must be submitted to the Ministry of Agriculture
          and the GMO biosafety Committee will evaluate it. Furthermore, other documents are needed with
          the application:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A document with the safety class of the GMO and a justification of this class</li>
          <li>An inspection report of the GMO</li>
          <li>A list of the safety action and precautionary measures</li>
          <li>A summary of the previous testing phases</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          After the permission to produce the GMO, report on the production, processing, safety controls, and
          the products’ whereabouts must be send to the Ministry of Agriculture and the local agricultural
          administrative department.<sup>6,7</sup>
        </p>
        <h2>Commercialization:</h2>
        <p>
          To market GMOs in China, a demand of marketing license is required by the Ministry of Agriculture.
          Also, to make advertisements on GMOs a special permit must be delivered by the Ministry of
          Agriculture. To export GMOs in China, an application must be submitted to the Ministry of
          Agriculture and a GMO safety certificate is required.</br>
          All GMOs sold in China are labelled with the name of the GM materials, and special restrictions if
          necessary.<sup>8,9</sup>
        </p>
        <h2>Consumption:</h2>
        <p>
          Only the GM food authorized by the government can be sold, moreover the product must be labelled
          as transgenic food and if it is a raw material, the GM material used must be described.<sup>8</sup>
