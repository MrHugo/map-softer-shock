        <h1>BRAZIL</h1>
        <p>
          Brazil is currently the second producer of GMO behind the United States with an area dedicated to
          GMO crops of 49.1 million of hectares in 2016, and about fifty commercialized GMOs in the country.<sup>1</sup>
          The major regulation about the genetically modified organism, in the country, is the <b>Law 11,105 of2005.</b>
          Following this law, to protect and preserve the environment, a National Biosafety Policy was
          created with National Biosafety Council. Also, a national commission, Comissão Técnica Nacional de
          Biossegurança, is created to regulate the biotechnology sector.<sup>2</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, to prevent the risk of a potential release of GMO in the environment, an international
          convention has been made that leads to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety on 2000. This protocol
          can help countries to have a basis regulation and methodology for modified organisms, to harmonize
          the regulation on biosafety on an international level, and a mechanism for international information
          exchange on biosafety.<sup>3,4</sup> Brazil ratified the Cartagena protocol on 2003.<sup>5</sup>
        </p>
        <h2>Research:</h2>
        <p>
          To practice researches on GMOs, an authorization of the Comissão Técnica Nacional de
          Biossegurança is needed and the laboratories and activities performed must apply under the law
          11,105 and the Normative Resolution No. 2 of 2006.<sup>6</sup>
        </p>
        <h2>Cultivation:</h2>
        <p>
          To cultivate GMOs, a company needs to create an Internal Biosafety Council, which must approve the
          release of the crops in the environment. After, a request must be submit to the Comissão Técnica
          Nacional de Biossegurança with:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Information of the GMO crops</li>
          <li>Information of the planned release</li>
          <li>Map of the planned release</li>
          <li>A request for the vegetal material</li>
          <li>A request for the release, and information on the company dated and signed by the legal representative of this one</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          During the cultivation, a minimal distance of 100 meters is needed between GMOs crops and non-
          GMOs. Also, records on security measures, agronomic practices, and data collection on the storage,
          material transfer, and eventual disposal of the GMOs and their by-products must be done.<sup>7,8</sup>
        </p>
        <h2>Commercialization:</h2>
        <p>
          Before the commercial release or the import of GMOs product, all the data collected on the product
          must be examined by the Comissão Técnica Nacional de Biossegurança that will judge if the product
          is authorized or not be sell in the country. Once the product is authorized, it needs to be labelled as a
          transgenic product.<sup>9,10</sup>
        </p>
        <h2>Consumption:</h2>
        <p>
          GMO food for human consumption is legal in Brazil, if the percentage GMO is superior to 1% in a
          product, this one must include a label to inform the population with the potential effect on the
          human health.<sup>10</sup>
