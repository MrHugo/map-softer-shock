        <h1>Mexico</h1>
        <p>Mexico cultivates 0.1 million of hectares of GMO crops in 2016 and 158 approved GMO for human
          consumption.<sup>1</sup> The major legislation of the country about GMO is the <b>Law on Biosecurity of
            Genetically Modified Organisms</b>. This regulation provides rules on the research, release,
            commercialization, exportation and importation of GMOs, and ensures the correct level of safety for
            each product.<sup>2</sup>
          </p>
          <p>Also, to prevent the risk of a potential release of GMO in the environment, an international
            convention has been made that leads to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety on 2000. This protocol
            can help countries to have a basis regulation and methodology for modified organisms, to harmonize
            the regulation on biosafety on an international level, and a mechanism for international information
            exchange on biosafety.<sup>3,4</sup> Mexico ratified the Cartagena protocol on 2002.<sup>5</sup>
          </p>
          <h2>Research:</h2>
          <p>To practice research on GMOs, an application from the ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of
            Environment and Natural Resources is required<sup>6</sup>
          </p>
          <h2>Cultivation:</h2>
          <p>To cultivate GMOs, the Mexico’s Departments of Environment and Agriculture must approve the
            experimental data and a risk study containing:
            <ul>
              <li>The identification of the characteristics of the GMO that can be a risk for the biological
                diversity</li>
                <li>An evaluation of the consequences of the materialization of the risk</li>
                <li>An estimation of the GMO to be a potential global risk</li>
                <li>Strategies to manage the risk of propagation and a part indicating if those risks are
                  acceptable or manageable<sup>6,7</sup></li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <h2>Commercialization:</h2>
              <p>To commercialize GMOs in the country, a risk assessment is required with information about the
                GMO. Then, the ministry of Agriculture and the ministry of Environment and Natural Resources can
                give a permit if the GMO is considered as safe for the environment and for human health. If the GMO
                is dedicated to human consumption, an authorization of the ministry of Health is required too. Finally
                a label indicating that the product is a GMO, its genetically acquired characteristics, its special
                requirements for its cultivation, and changes in reproductive capabilities is necessary.<sup>8,9</sup></p>
                <h2>Consumption:</h2>
                <p>GMO food for human consumption is legal in Mexico, but an authorization of the Mexico’s
                  Department of Health is required. To have it, a study of the risks for the human health is needed and
                  if no evidence of risks are found, the product can be sold. The product need to have a label indicating
                  its GMO origin, and its nutritional value and ingredients if these characteristics are significantly
                  different from conventional products.<sup>9</sup>
