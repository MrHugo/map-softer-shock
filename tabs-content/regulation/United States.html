        <h1>United States</h1>
        <p>The United State are the major GMOs producer with 72.9 million of hectares of biotech crops in
          2016.<sup>1</sup> This position is explained by the specific regulation of the country, the Coordinated
          Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology, published in 1986 which focus on the nature of the
          product and not on its fabrication. So, the regulation of the United States is favorable on the
          development of the GMOs in the country and they are globally treated as normal products. The US
          Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service regulates GMO plants, the
          Food and Drug Administration regulates GMOs in food, drugs or biological product and the
          Environmental Protection Agency regulates GMOs on pesticides.<sup>2</sup>
        </p>
        <p>The United States did not sign any international protocol on biosafety.
        </p>
        <h2>Research:</h2>
        <p>There are no specific regulations for modified organisms, they must be compared as a drug and thesame level of biosafety is needed.
        </p>
        <h2>Cultivation:</h2>
        <p>To release GMO in the environment, the US Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health
          Inspection Service can grant the authorization through three different procedures:
          <ul>
            <li><u>The notification procedure</u> if the plant is considered as safe for the environment.</li>
            <li><u>The permit procedure</u> requires a special authorization where the following documents must
              be given to the APHIS: the donor organism, the recipient organism, the composition of the
              regulated article, the expression of altered genetic material in the regulated article and the
              molecular biology of the system used to produce the article, the locality where the donor
              and recipient organisms and the regulated article were developed, the purpose of the
              regulated article, the quantity to be introduced, processes to prevent release, the intended
              destination, use, and distribution, and the final disposition of the regulated article.</li>
              <li><u>The nonregulated status</u>, if the GMO tests have shown that the plant is not a risk for the
                environment, an authorization can be granted with the following documents: detailed
                biological information on the regulated article and the recipient organism, published and
                unpublished scientific studies, data from field tests, and other information designed to assist
                APHIS in determining whether the plant constitutes a pest.<sup>3,4</sup></li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>Commercialization:</h2>
            <p>USA considers GMO food as safe, so no premarket approval is required most of the time but if the
              GMO differs significantly from the natural product, a premarket approval as a food additive is
              required from the Food and Drug Administration. If the product is significantly different, a label is
              required if there are safety issues as allergens.<sup>5,6</sup></p>
              <h2>Consumption:</h2>
              <p>The consumption of GMOs is authorized in the USA because the Food and Drug Administration
                considers food created by GMOs as safe for the human health. Also, label on GMO food is not
                mandatory, only GMOs that are significantly different from the natural product have a label or a
                different name than the original product.<sup>5</sup>
