    <p>In China, the agriculture biotech industry is supported by the central government of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China (PRC or China). It is an emerging sector of strategic importance. According to the data published by the MOA (Ministry of Agriculture of the people Republic of China) on April 27, 2013, China has issued GMO Safety Certificates to seven domestically developed, genetically modified crops. This list is composed of a varieties of tomato (1997), cotton (1997), petunia (1999), sweet pepper and chili pepper (1999), papaya (2006), rice (2009), and corn (2009).<sup>1</sup>
</p>
<p>China works on several projects, there is the agri-food sector and also the environment sector such as the pollution problem that affects a big majority of people in the country. Because China is one of the most polluted country in the world, the environmental concerns are driven forces of research on the genetic circuits for bioremediation.
</p>

<p>In this case, Synthetic Biology research are applied, which in turn call upon most useful and diverse applications or systems to reduce environmental pollution. You can find below some examples to decrease the environmental impact due to pollution of China:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Photosynthetic microalgae are emerging as potential biomass feedstock for sustainable production of biofuels and value-added bio products.<sup>2</sup></li>
  <li>Genetic circuits (to degrade environmental hazards, such as heavy metals, insecticides, phenols, and arsenic), could be designed to enable the host organisms to have the ability to act as biosensors and bioreactors to sense and break down environmental pollutants.<sup>2</sup></li>
  <li>The engineering of <i>Rhodococcus erythropolis</i> for bioremediation has been investigated by a team from State Key Laboratory of Microbial Technology, Shandong University. The microbes were engineered to degrade dibenzothiophene, carbazole, and dibenzofuran to nontoxic metabolites.<sup>3</sup></p></li>

    <h2>INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS</h2>

    <p>In China, Synthetic Biology related research started as early as the 1960s when Chinese scientists made the first protein by chemical synthesis (synthetic insulin).<sup>7</sup>
		</p>

		<p>Since then, biotechnology developments in China have been carry out, (more on research for agricultural applications but less for medical and pharmaceutical ones. However, since the launch of funding projects 863 and 973 Programs, the development and utilization of molecular techniques in life science have become common.<sup>2</sup>
		</p>

    <p>Synthetic biology projects are fostered and financially helped by the Chinese government.  There are specially 5 research activities that uses Synthetic biology tools such as Genetics circuits, Minimal genomes, Chemical synthetic biology, Protocells and DNA synthesis.Each subfield carries active research topics, for example in the Protocells and DNA synthesis subfield there are activities such as use basic types of protocells to study energy conversion or improve DNA synthesis methods.<sup>7</sup>
