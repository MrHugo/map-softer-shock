		<h1>China</h1>
  
		<p>China is one of the most important producer of GMO in the world with a surface of 2.8 million of
		hectares of GM crops in 2016 and the production of 60 GMOs species.<sup>1</sup> Actually, China doesn’t have a
		specific law to regulate GMOs in the country, but biotechnology is considered as an emerging sector
		of strategic importance. That is why the State Council and the Ministry of Agriculture enacted
		multiple law on the testing, production, and marketing of GMOs.<sup>2</sup>
		</p>
  
		<p>Also, to prevent the risk of a potential release of GMO in the environment, an international
		convention has been made that leads to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety on 2000. This protocol
		can help countries to have a basis regulation and methodology for modified organisms, to harmonize
		the regulation on biosafety on an international level, and a mechanism for international information
		exchange on biosafety.<sup>3,4</sup> China ratified the Cartagena protocol on 2005.<sup>5</sup>
		</p>
  
		<h2>Research:</h2>
  
		<p>To performed research on GMOs, the laboratory need an authorization from the National Biosafety
		Committee, further approval are not necessary unless the GMO is classified as a class III or class IV
		level of biosafety.<sup>6</sup>
		</p>
  
		<h2>Cultivation:</h2>
  
		<p>To start the cultivation of a GMO, an application must be submitted to the Ministry of Agriculture
		and the GMO biosafety Committee will evaluate it. Furthermore, other documents are needed with
		the application:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>A document with the safety class of the GMO and a justification of this class</li>
			<li>An inspection report of the GMO</li>
			<li>A list of the safety action and precautionary measures</li>
			<li>A summary of the previous testing phases</li>
		</ul>
  
		<p>After the permission to produce the GMO, report on the production, processing, safety controls, and
		the products’ whereabouts must be send to the Ministry of Agriculture and the local agricultural
		administrative department.<sup>6,7</sup>
		</p>

		<h2>Commercialization:</h2>
  
		<p>To market GMOs in China, a demand of marketing license is required by the Ministry of Agriculture.
		Also, to make advertisements on GMOs a special permit must be delivered by the Ministry of
		Agriculture. To export GMOs in China, an application must be submitted to the Ministry of
		Agriculture and a GMO safety certificate is required.</br>
		All GMOs sold in China are labelled with the name of the GM materials, and special restrictions if
		necessary.<sup>8,9</sup>
		</p>
	
		<h2>Consumption:</h2>
  
		<p>Only the GM food authorized by the government can be sold, moreover the product must be labelled
		as transgenic food and if it is a raw material, the GM material used must be described.<sup>8</sup>

		<h1>AGRI-FOOD AND ENVIRONMENT SECTOR</h1>
        
            
		<h2>INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS</h2>
			
        <p>In China, the agriculture biotech industry is supported by the central government of the People’s Republic of China (PRC or China). It is an emerging sector of strategic importance. According to the data published by the MOA (Ministry of Agriculture of the people Republic of China) on April 27, 2013, China has issued GMO Safety Certificates to seven domestically developed, genetically modified crops. This list is composed of a varieties of tomato (1997), cotton (1997), petunia (1999), sweet pepper and chili pepper (1999), papaya (2006), rice (2009), and corn (2009).<sup>1</sup>
		</p>
            
		<p>According to China’s 12th Five-Year Plan on National Economic and Social Development for 2011–2015, the country will “speed up the innovation. They want to improve application of biotechnology breeding in agriculture but also develop new biological variety with important application value and independent intellectual property rights.<sup>1</sup>
		</p>
            
		<p>This may be based on the fact that China is a country of abundant and diverse biological resources, as well as a wide range of climates. This has made China the leading country in crop breeding.<sup>1</sup>
		</p>
            
		<p>China works on several projects, there is the agri-food sector and also the environment sector such as the pollution problem that affects a big majority of people in the country. Because China is one of the most polluted country in the world, the environmental concerns are driven forces of research on the genetic circuits for bioremediation.
		</p>
            
		<p>In this case, Synthetic Biology research are applied, which in turn call upon most useful and diverse applications or systems to reduce environmental pollution. You can find below some examples to decrease the environmental impact due to pollution of China:
		</p>
            
		<ul>
			<li>Photosynthetic microalgae are emerging as potential biomass feedstock for sustainable production of biofuels and value-added bio products.<sup>2</sup></li>
			<li>Genetic circuits (to degrade environmental hazards, such as heavy metals, insecticides, phenols, and arsenic), could be designed to enable the host organisms to have the ability to act as biosensors and bioreactors to sense and break down environmental pollutants.<sup>2</sup></li>
			<li>The engineering of <i>Rhodococcus erythropolis</i> for bioremediation has been investigated by a team from State Key Laboratory of Microbial Technology, Shandong University. The microbes were engineered to degrade dibenzothiophene, carbazole, and dibenzofuran to nontoxic metabolites.<sup>3</sup></p></li>
		</ul>
			
        <p>Some specific study demonstrates the feasibility of improving photosynthetic capacity by the genetic manipulation of the Calvin cycle in the typical green microalga <i>Chlorella vulgaris</i>. The authors, used a plasmid transit peptide to upstream of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and confirmed its expression in the chloroplast of <i>C. vulgaris</i>. This work represents a proof-of-concept effort to enhance photosynthetic capacity in green microalgae.This project could improve the production of O2, providing more fresh in China.<sup>4</sup>
		</p>
            
        <p>In the sector of the food industry, projects are more link to food issues or crops issues such as:
		</p>
            
		<ul>
			<li>Aflatoxin contamination in peanuts.</br> This food contamination poses major challenges for vulnerable populations of sub-Saharan Africa and south. Consequently, researchers from the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) developed aflatoxin-free peanuts. They have achieved a high level of aflatoxin resistance in peanut by over expressing antifungal plant defensins MsDef1 and MtDef4.2.  This study result in a significantly reduction of aflatoxin contamination.<sup>5</sup></li>
			<li>Wheat diseases.</br> A global collaboration of researchers from Australia, China and Norway have identified a gene called Lr67 how will avoid certain of the three species of rust (black, brown and yellow) and powdery mildew. Researches are very important, because rust (black, brown and yellow) diseases are one of the most important constraints in the global production of wheat.<sup>6</sup></li>
		</ul>
			
        <h2>iGEM PROJECTS</h2>
            
		<h3>iGEM 2016 - Nanjing-China</h3>
			
        <p>Last year, a team from Nanjing proposes a new method to construct an artificial photosynthetic system in <i>E.coli</i> with the help of metal-binding proteins and surface display machinery. They successfully achieve aerobic hydrogen production using E.coli hydrogenase 1 under normal conditions (see the sheme below).

        <p>They were nominated for the best environnment project. Their work is described in more detail on their <a target = "_blank" href="http://2016.igem.org/Team:Nanjing-China/project" > web page </a>.
		</p>
			
        <h3>iGEM 2016 - SCAU-China</h3>
			
        <p>Astaxanthin is a natural keto-carotenoid and cannot be synthesized in animals. To resolve this, SCAU-China  used rice (Oryza sativa L.) as chassis organism to produce a genetically modified organism (GMO) named aSTARice, which enables biosynthesis of astaxanthin in the rice endosperm. To achieve this goal, four genes derived from maize, algae, and bacteria, respectively, were expressed under the control of endosperm-specific promoters. They succeed in detection of astaxanthin in the endosperm of resultant aSTARice (see the scheme below).

        <h1>HEALTH SECTOR</h1>

        <h2>INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS</h2>
                
		<p>In China, Synthetic Biology related research started as early as the 1960s when Chinese scientists made the first protein by chemical synthesis (synthetic insulin).<sup>7</sup>
		</p>
                
		<p>Since then, biotechnology developments in China have been carry out, (more on research for agricultural applications but less for medical and pharmaceutical ones. However, since the launch of funding projects 863 and 973 Programs, the development and utilization of molecular techniques in life science have become common.<sup>2</sup>
		</p>
                
		<p>Synthetic biology projects are fostered and financially helped by the Chinese government.  There are specially 5 research activities that uses Synthetic biology tools such as Genetics circuits, Minimal genomes, Chemical synthetic biology, Protocells and DNA synthesis.Each subfield carries active research topics, for example in the Protocells and DNA synthesis subfield there are activities such as use basic types of protocells to study energy conversion or improve DNA synthesis methods.<sup>7</sup>
		</p>
                
		<p>Moreover, China’s interest in the field emerged around 2007, when the first Chinese iGEM team from Peking University appeared on the stage and became the world champions with their project, “Towards Self-Differentiated Bacterial Assembly Line.” Since then, China has doubled down on its investment in synthetic biology with a coordinated approach.<sup>7</sup>
		</p>

        <h2>iGEM PROJECTS</h2>
			
        <h3>iGEM 2016 - BNU-China</h3>
              
		<p>Last year, BNU China focused on the drug screening of anti-cancer medicines. They wanted to prevent the growth of tumor cells by inhibiting the disaggregation of microtubule. The system is based on an anti-cancer medicines called Taxol because it can inhibit disaggregation and preventing the tumor cells from growing. Consequently, this team developed a new system to detect the existence of Taxol and quantified its concentration through fluorescence intensity (see the scheme below).

		</p>

        <h3>iGEM 2015 - NJU-China</h3>
			
        <p>In 2015, the team of NJU China develop a strategy to treat opioid addiction and to reduce relapse. Opioids act primarily as Mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist to activate the reward pathway in the brain. Thus, this project selects MOR as a therapeutic target for the treatment of opioid addiction and for the prevention of a relapse to opioid use. They propose a strategy of using RVG exosomes to encapsulate MOR siRNA and specifically deliver them to the brain.
