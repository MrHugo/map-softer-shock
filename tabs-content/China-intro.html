    <h1>China regulation</h1>
    <p>China is one of the most important producer of GMO in the world with a surface of 2.8 million of
      hectares of GM crops in 2016 and the production of 60 GMOs species.<sup>1</sup> Actually, China doesn’t have a
      specific law to regulate GMOs in the country, but biotechnology is considered as an emerging sector
      of strategic importance. That is why the State Council and the Ministry of Agriculture enacted
      multiple law on the testing, production, and marketing of GMOs.<sup>2</sup>
    </p>

    <p>Also, to prevent the risk of a potential release of GMO in the environment, an international
      convention has been made that leads to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety on 2000. This protocol
      can help countries to have a basis regulation and methodology for modified organisms, to harmonize
      the regulation on biosafety on an international level, and a mechanism for international information
      exchange on biosafety.<sup>3,4</sup> China ratified the Cartagena protocol on 2005.<sup>5</sup>

            <h2>INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS</h2>

            <p>In China, the agriculture biotech industry is supported by the central government of the People’s Republic of China (PRC or China). It is an emerging sector of strategic importance. According to the data published by the MOA (Ministry of Agriculture of the people Republic of China) on April 27, 2013, China has issued GMO Safety Certificates to seven domestically developed, genetically modified crops. This list is composed of a varieties of tomato (1997), cotton (1997), petunia (1999), sweet pepper and chili pepper (1999), papaya (2006), rice (2009), and corn (2009).<sup>1</sup>
            </p>
            <p>China works on several projects, there is the agri-food sector and also the environment sector such as the pollution problem that affects a big majority of people in the country. Because China is one of the most polluted country in the world, the environmental concerns are driven forces of research on the genetic circuits for bioremediation.

            <p>In China, Synthetic Biology related research started as early as the 1960s when Chinese scientists made the first protein by chemical synthesis (synthetic insulin).<sup>7</sup>
            </p>

            <p>Since then, biotechnology developments in China have been carry out, (more on research for agricultural applications but less for medical and pharmaceutical ones. However, since the launch of funding projects 863 and 973 Programs, the development and utilization of molecular techniques in life science have become common.<sup>2</sup>
            </p>

            <p>Synthetic biology projects are fostered and financially helped by the Chinese government.  There are specially 5 research activities that uses Synthetic biology tools such as Genetics circuits, Minimal genomes, Chemical synthetic biology, Protocells and DNA synthesis.Each subfield carries active research topics, for example in the Protocells and DNA synthesis subfield there are activities such as use basic types of protocells to study energy conversion or improve DNA synthesis methods.<sup>7</sup>
