              <p>Mexico has been planting biotech crops since 1996, and is one of the six
                pioneer with USA, Brazil, Canada, India and Argentina and biotech planting
                countries.<sup>1</sup>

              <p>Since 1996, Mexico had 158 approvals for GMOs food cultivars and feed use.

              <p>Currently, a few companies in Mexico are demonstrating some of the practical possibilities
                that synthetic biology can offers:<sup>1</sup>

              <p>In October 2009, Mexican researchers and companies directors discussed
                about the future development of applied synthetic biology, reaching two
                main conclusions. First, Mexico is is relatively late in examining these
                issues. Secondly, the research directions that would allow Mexico to be
                competitive were not clearly defined.

              </p>

              <p>Despite this, Mexico has made important contributions to synthetic biology.
              </p>

              <p>In 1980, the Mexican scientist Francisco Bolivar Zapata was able to access
                the DNA of a pancreatic cell and from there obtained the gene that encodes insulin.
