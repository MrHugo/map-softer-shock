    <p> Total number of answers: 80 (as of 13/10/2017)
   </p>

   <p> The goal of this survey is to understand the population’s point of view regarding GMOs and our “Softer Shock” iGEM project that intends to use GMOs on crops. This study was made in the context of Human Practices to annotate the interactive map with relevant data.
   </p>

   <p> 12 out of 23 questions were selected for this survey analysis. Below are shown the results related to the public perception of GMOs and our iGEM project. We have benefited from the help of other French teams that have shared the survey to their families and friends.
   </p>

   <p>In Mexico, people have a global mixed point of view concerning GMOs. 91% of the population is aware of what a GMO is and 54% and 50% think it is not safe for health and for environment, respectively.
   </p>

   <p> We also noticed that 17%-19% are uncertain about the safety of GMOs for health and the environment. This means that a significant proportion of the Mexican population is probably not sufficiently informed about these two subjects.

    <p>Mexico cultivates 0.1 million of hectares of GMO crops in 2016 and 158 approved GMO for human
		consumption.<sup>1</sup> The major legislation of the country about GMO is the <b>Law on Biosecurity of
		Genetically Modified Organisms</b>. This regulation provides rules on the research, release,
		commercialization, exportation and importation of GMOs, and ensures the correct level of safety for
		each product.<sup>2</sup>
		</p>

		<p>Also, to prevent the risk of a potential release of GMO in the environment, an international
		convention has been made that leads to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety on 2000. This protocol
		can help countries to have a basis regulation and methodology for modified organisms, to harmonize
		the regulation on biosafety on an international level, and a mechanism for international information
		exchange on biosafety.<sup>3,4</sup> Mexico ratified the Cartagena protocol on 2002.<sup>5</sup>

              <p>In October 2009, Mexican researchers and companies directors discussed
                about the future development of applied synthetic biology, reaching two
                main conclusions. First, Mexico is is relatively late in examining these
                issues. Secondly, the research directions that would allow Mexico to be
                competitive were not clearly defined.

              </p>

              <p>Despite this, Mexico has made important contributions to synthetic biology.
              </p>

              <p>In 1980, the Mexican scientist Francisco Bolivar Zapata was able to access
                the DNA of a pancreatic cell and from there obtained the gene that encodes insulin.
