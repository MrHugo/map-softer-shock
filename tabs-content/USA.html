		<h1>United States</h1>
  
		<p>The United State are the major GMOs producer with 72.9 million of hectares of biotech crops in
		2016.<sup>1</sup> This position is explained by the specific regulation of the country, the Coordinated
		Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology, published in 1986 which focus on the nature of the
		product and not on its fabrication. So, the regulation of the United States is favorable on the
		development of the GMOs in the country and they are globally treated as normal products. The US
		Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service regulates GMO plants, the
		Food and Drug Administration regulates GMOs in food, drugs or biological product and the
		Environmental Protection Agency regulates GMOs on pesticides.<sup>2</sup>
		</p>
  
		<p>The United States did not sign any international protocol on biosafety.
		</p>
  
		<h2>Research:</h2>
  
		<p>There are no specific regulations for modified organisms, they must be compared as a drug and thesame level of biosafety is needed.
		</p>
  
		<h2>Cultivation:</h2>
  
		<p>To release GMO in the environment, the US Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health
		Inspection Service can grant the authorization through three different procedures:
		</p>
  
	<ul>
		<li><u>The notification procedure</u> if the plant is considered as safe for the environment.</li>
		<li><u>The permit procedure</u> requires a special authorization where the following documents must
        be given to the APHIS: the donor organism, the recipient organism, the composition of the
        regulated article, the expression of altered genetic material in the regulated article and the
        molecular biology of the system used to produce the article, the locality where the donor
        and recipient organisms and the regulated article were developed, the purpose of the
        regulated article, the quantity to be introduced, processes to prevent release, the intended
        destination, use, and distribution, and the final disposition of the regulated article.</li>
		<li><u>The nonregulated status</u>, if the GMO tests have shown that the plant is not a risk for the
        environment, an authorization can be granted with the following documents: detailed
        biological information on the regulated article and the recipient organism, published and
        unpublished scientific studies, data from field tests, and other information designed to assist
        APHIS in determining whether the plant constitutes a pest.<sup>3,4</sup></li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Commercialization:</h2>
  
	<p>USA considers GMO food as safe, so no premarket approval is required most of the time but if the
    GMO differs significantly from the natural product, a premarket approval as a food additive is
    required from the Food and Drug Administration. If the product is significantly different, a label is
    required if there are safety issues as allergens.<sup>5,6</sup>
	</p>
  
	<h2>Consumption:</h2>
  
	<p>The consumption of GMOs is authorized in the USA because the Food and Drug Administration
    considers food created by GMOs as safe for the human health. Also, label on GMO food is not
    mandatory, only GMOs that are significantly different from the natural product have a label or a
    different name than the original product.<sup>5</sup>

		<h1>AGRI-FOOD AND ENVIRONMENT SECTOR</h1>

        <h2>INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS</h2>
		  
        <p>Since 1996, genetically modified seeds have been available in the United States. Currently, genetically modified maize, soybean and cotton crops are the overwhelming majority of crops.<sup>1</sup>
		</p>
          
		<p> USA planted 72.9 million hectares in 2016, covering 39% of the global biotech crop plantings. This country remained the top producer of biotech crops all around the world. Their agriculture is characterized by strong mechanization. They are using half the tractors in the world and pesticides are spread by plane. Consequently, GMOs are particularly "relevant" in this kind of context (large area, strong mechanization ...)<sup>1</sup>
		</p>
		  
        <p> However, for a majority of crops, herbicide-tolerant GMOs have become the norm. In 2013, 93% of soybean crops became tolerant to herbicides and particularly to glyphosate. Moreover, 75% of the agricultural area of the United State are insect resistant.<sup>1</sup>
		</p>
          
		<p> Nowadays, many companies in USA are working on synthetic biology to performing the nutritional value of crops. Recently, Rutgers scientist discovered a way to reduce animal feed and food production costs by increasing a key nutrient in corn. They found an efficient way to enhance the nutritional value of corn by inserting a bacterial gene that causes it to produce a key nutrient called methionine. This new discovery could benefit millions of people in developing countries but also for the reducing worldwide animal feed costs.<sup>2</sup>
		</p>
          
		<p> Because energy becomes increasingly rare, an institution called Woods Hole Oceanographic are developing a new project using seaweed. Currently in the USA, seaweed is primarily used in food for humans and animals and mostly comes from imported farmed product or wild harvests. However, researchers at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) try to use seaweed as an energy production for our daily life. They are developing a breeding program for sugar kelp (Saccharina latissimi) using gene sequencing and genomic resources for faster, more accurate and efficient selective breeding. They expect to develop novel genomic tools that will accelerate the production of improved plants.<sup>3</sup>
		</p>

        <h2>iGEM PROJECTS</h2>
		  
        <h3>iGEM 2016 - Harvard</h3>
		  
        <p>It is difficult to clean up and track the plastic in the ocean. Consequently, last year, an iGEM team from Harvard developed a project called “Plastiback” that degrade plastic more simply, efficiently and sustainably. It is a synthetic-biology system using a microbe called Ideonella Sakaiensis to degrade PET and engineered it into a PET detection device (see diagram below).
		</p>

        <img src ="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/5/58/Interactive_map_-_Ionis_2017_-_USA_-_Harvard_2.png"/>

		<p>They were nominated for the best environment project. Their work is described in more detail on their <a target = "_blank" href="http://2016.igem.org/Team:Harvard_BioDesign" > web page</a>.</p>

        <h3>iGEM 2016 - Pittsburgh</h3>
		  
        <p>Because water is a necessity for the daily life it is crucial to guarantee its purity and safety. To answer at this issue, the Pittsburgh team developed a project called “HOT METAL SWITCH” which consist of a cell-free sensor that conditionally expresses lacZ only in the presence of the target metal, either lead or thallium.
		</p>
          
		<p>This system is cheap, easy to use, efficient, producing results in less than an hour and based on a paper-based sensor. It relied on RNA-based sensors to sense small molecules. The circuit will express LacZ, producing a visible color change through the presence of lead.
		</p>

		<p>They were nominated for the best environment project. Their work is described in more detail on their <a target = "_blank" href="http://2016.igem.org/Team:Pittsburgh/Project_Overview" > web page</a>.</p>

        <h1>HEALTH SECTOR</h1>

        <h2>INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS</h2>
		  
        <p>The United States is in the lead position in SB research: they host most of the research entities (institutes or universities), and conduct most of the R&D activities.
		</p>
          
		<p>They have a web page called “synthetic biology projects” in which you can map the emerging synthetic Biology landscape in US. The <a target = "_blank" href="http://www.synbioproject.org/news/" > web page</a>
		</p>

		<p>GMOs in drugs, and biological products are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act.
		</p>

		<p>Nowadays, many companies in USA are working on synthetic biology to cure some diseases such as the Gaucher disease. This disease is an inherited lysosomal storage disorder in humans that affects an estimated 10,000 people worldwide and can cause important symptoms.<sup>4</sup>
		</p>

		<p>Consequently, this company (Protalix) developed a treatment called ELELYSO  Protalix is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of recombinant therapeutic proteins. They are developing recombinant proteins in a cost-effective, industrial-scale manner.<sup>4</sup>
		</p>

		<p>Protalix BioTherapeutics Announce FDA Approval Of ELELYSO a therapeutical treatment for the Gaucher disease. This treatment was the first approved plant cell-expressed using genetically engineered carrot cells.<sup>4</sup>
		</p>

        <h2>iGEM PROJECTS</h2>
		  
        <h3>iGEM 2016 - UCLA</h3>
		            
		<p>Last year, the team of UCLA engineered a new systems of targeted drug delivery to answer the drug problems. Conventional nonspecific drug delivery lacks specificity and efficiency, leading to undesirable side-effect. To remedies at this problem, they took a synthetic and cellular approach to targeted drug therapy via protein cages and recombinant bacteria.
		</p>
          
		<p>Furthermore, they developed an alternative to broad spectrum antibiotics using contact-dependent inhibition (CDI) systems. This approach allow to mediate intercellular competition between gram-negative strains. Moreover, through the technique of Gibson assembly and Lambda-red recombineering, they developed bacteria capable of inhibiting selected strains by exporting foreign CDI systems into DH5-alpha.
		</p>
