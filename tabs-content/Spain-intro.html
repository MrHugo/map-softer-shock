    <p>Spain is one of the biggest producer of GMO crops in the EU with 0.1 million of hectares of biotech
		crops in 2016.<sup>1</sup> As a member of the European Union, Spain is strongly affected by the EU rules, the
		first one being the directive <b>2001/18/EC</b>, which regulates the release of GMO on the environment
		and the regulation <b>(EC) No 1829/2003</b>, which defines the modified feed and food that can be placed
		on the market and can be consumed.<sup>2</sup> Moreover, a national law (<b>Law 9/2003</b> and the <b>royal decree
		178/2004</b>) was also voted to provide other restrictions on GMOs. These laws led to the creation of
		the National Biosafety Commission and the Inter-Ministerial Council for Genetically Modified
		Organisms.<sup>3</sup>
		</p>
    <p>Also, to prevent the risk of a potential release of GMO in the environment, international convention
		has been made that leads to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety on 2000. This protocol can help
		countries to have a basis regulation and methodology for modified organisms, to harmonize the
		regulation on biosafety on an international level, and a mechanism for international information
		exchange on biosafety.<sup>4,5</sup> Spain ratified the Cartagena protocol on 2002.<sup>6</sup>

              <p>Spain remains one of the few EU countries that allows the use of GM crops
                and has become the highest yielding producer in EU.
              </p>

              <p>The autonomous regions of Aragon and Catalonia had the largest share of
                biotech maize (70%) of Spainâ€™s total biotech maize plantings, as the corn borer
                insect is endemic in these areas.

              <p>Today, some companies in Spain are demonstrating the possibilities that synthetic
                biology can offer through fundamental and applied research projects.
