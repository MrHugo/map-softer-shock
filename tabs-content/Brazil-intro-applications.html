    <p>Brazil is the engine of growth in biotech crops worldwide.<sup>1</sup>
		</p>
    <p>An anecdote from an iGEM 2017 Brazilian USP team member recalls that:
“At first GMOs were forbidden to produce in Brazil but some farmers started
to use them illegally because they had a better yield and it was less expensive.
After few years most of Brazil was using GMOs crop and the government had to allow
he country to produce GMOs, in conclusion they banished the law just because
they were too many to be controlled and also because of the country economy that
was much better using GMOs.”
</p>
<p>Today, several companies in Brazil are demonstrating the possibilities
that synthetic biology can offer through specific industrial projects, such as a fast growing GM eucalyptus with 20 percent higher
productivity, new techniques to improve traditional harvesting etc ..

    <p>Synthetic biology is not well developed in the health field. We believe
that in few years the health sector will start to use synthetic biology tools
as we can see in the article Synthetic Biology: An Emerging Field for Developing
Economies.</p>
