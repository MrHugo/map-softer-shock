      <h1>Survey analysis: Brazil</h1>

      <p><b> Total number of answers: 102 (as of 13/10/2017) </b></p>

      <p> The goal of this survey is to understand the population’s point of view regarding GMOs and our “Softer Shock” iGEM project that intends to use GMOs on crops. This study was made in the context of Human Practices to annotate the interactive map with relevant data.
      </p>

      <p> <span class="orange-text">12 out of 23 questions were selected for this survey analysis</span>. Below are shown the results related to the public perception of GMOs and our iGEM project. We have benefited from the help of other French teams that have shared the survey to their families and friends.
      </p>

      <p>In Brazil people have a <span class="orange-text">global positive view of GMOs</span>. 90% of the population is aware of what a GMO is and <span class="orange-text">51% think it is safe for health and 38% think it is safe for the environment</span>. Therefore, we may well receive positive feedback for our project implementation in Brazil.
      </p>

      <p>We also notice that 32%-33% are uncertain about the safety of GMOs for health and environment. <b>This means that a significant portion of the Brazilian population is not sufficiently informed about these two subjects to make their own opinion</b>.

            <h1>Brazil regulation</h1>

            <p>Brazil is currently the second producer of GMO behind the United States with an area dedicated to
              GMO crops of 49.1 million of hectares in 2016, and about fifty commercialized GMOs in the country.<sup>1</sup>
              The major regulation about the genetically modified organism, in the country, is the <b>Law 11,105 of
                2005.</b> Following this law, to protect and preserve the environment, a National Biosafety Policy was
                created with National Biosafety Council. Also, a national commission, Comissão Técnica Nacional de
                Biossegurança, is created to regulate the biotechnology sector.<sup>2</sup>
              </p>

              <p>Also, to prevent the risk of a potential release of GMO in the environment, an international
                convention has been made that leads to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety on 2000. This protocol
                can help countries to have a basis regulation and methodology for modified organisms, to harmonize
                the regulation on biosafety on an international level, and a mechanism for international information
                exchange on biosafety.<sup>3,4</sup> Brazil ratified the Cartagena protocol on 2003.<sup>5</sup>

                <p>Brazil is the engine of growth in biotech crops worldwide.<sup>1</sup>
                </p>
                <p>An anecdote from an iGEM 2017 Brazilian USP team member recalls that:
                  “At first GMOs were forbidden to produce in Brazil but some farmers started
                  to use them illegally because they had a better yield and it was less expensive.
                  After few years most of Brazil was using GMOs crop and the government had to allow
                  he country to produce GMOs, in conclusion they banished the law just because
                  they were too many to be controlled and also because of the country economy that
                  was much better using GMOs.”
                </p>
                <p>Today, several companies in Brazil are demonstrating the possibilities
                  that synthetic biology can offer through specific industrial projects, such as a
                  fast growing GM eucalyptus with 20 percent higher
                  productivity, new techniques to improve traditional harvesting etc ..
