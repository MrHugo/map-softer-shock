              <p>Brazil is the engine of growth in biotech crops worldwide.<sup>1</sup>

              <p>An anecdote from an iGEM 2017 Brazilian USP team member recalls that:
                “At first GMOs were forbidden to produce in Brazil but some farmers started
                to use them illegally because they had a better yield and it was less expensive.
                After few years most of Brazil was using GMOs crop and the government had to allow
                he country to produce GMOs, in conclusion they banished the law just because
                they were too many to be controlled and also because of the country economy that
                was much better using GMOs.”
              </p>
              <p>Today, several companies in Brazil are demonstrating the possibilities
                that synthetic biology can offer through specific industrial projects, such as a
                fast growing GM eucalyptus with 20 percent higher
                productivity, new techniques to improve traditional harvesting etc ..

                <h1>Brazil regulation</h1>

                <p>Brazil is currently the second producer of GMO behind the United States with an area dedicated to
                  GMO crops of 49.1 million of hectares in 2016, and about fifty commercialized GMOs in the country.<sup>1</sup>
                  The major regulation about the genetically modified organism, in the country, is the <b>Law 11,105 of
                    2005.</b> Following this law, to protect and preserve the environment, a National Biosafety Policy was
                    created with National Biosafety Council. Also, a national commission, Comissão Técnica Nacional de
                    Biossegurança, is created to regulate the biotechnology sector.<sup>2</sup>
                  </p>

                  <p>Also, to prevent the risk of a potential release of GMO in the environment, an international
                    convention has been made that leads to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety on 2000. This protocol
                    can help countries to have a basis regulation and methodology for modified organisms, to harmonize
                    the regulation on biosafety on an international level, and a mechanism for international information
                    exchange on biosafety.<sup>3,4</sup> Brazil ratified the Cartagena protocol on 2003.<sup>5</sup>
