		<h1>Brazil regulation</h1>

    <p>Brazil is currently the second producer of GMO behind the United States with an area dedicated to
		GMO crops of 49.1 million of hectares in 2016, and about fifty commercialized GMOs in the country.<sup>1</sup>
		The major regulation about the genetically modified organism, in the country, is the <b>Law 11,105 of
		2005.</b> Following this law, to protect and preserve the environment, a National Biosafety Policy was
		created with National Biosafety Council. Also, a national commission, Comissão Técnica Nacional de
		Biossegurança, is created to regulate the biotechnology sector.<sup>2</sup>
		</p>

    <p>Also, to prevent the risk of a potential release of GMO in the environment, an international
		convention has been made that leads to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety on 2000. This protocol
		can help countries to have a basis regulation and methodology for modified organisms, to harmonize
		the regulation on biosafety on an international level, and a mechanism for international information
		exchange on biosafety.<sup>3,4</sup> Brazil ratified the Cartagena protocol on 2003.<sup>5</sup>
